# NOTES

Engineering notes for the browser video editor prototype.

## Conventions

Standing rules that apply to future work, kept here so they survive between sessions.

- **Custom components carry a `-Rep` suffix on both the id and the display name.** Every
  component we build from now on is named `<thing>-Rep` with a display name ending in
  " Rep" — e.g. id `orbit-headline-Rep`, name "Orbit Headline Rep". Applied retroactively to
  the two Stage 13/14 components in Stage 15. `stat-counter` keeps its original id: it is the
  only pre-`-Rep` component still in the library after Stage 16, and renaming it would break
  the projects and component_metadata rows that reference it.
- **A component's `meta.json` `description` is one short sentence, about five words.** It is
  a label, not documentation — "Replika conversation with typing dots", not a paragraph on
  timing and fonts. It is the line the Component Library panel puts under the name and the
  blurb `list_components` returns, and long ones wrapped to four or five lines in the panel.
  Anything a caller actually needs — delimiters, prefixes, accepted values, aspect ratio —
  belongs on the parameter it concerns (`description` / `lineHint`) or in the dimension
  fields, which are read as data rather than skimmed as prose. All five descriptions were cut
  to this length in one pass; per-param docs were deliberately left long.
- **A component's directory name must equal its `meta.json` id.** `listComponents` throws on
  a mismatch, so a rename means moving the directory too. By convention the project and scene
  filenames match as well (`src/projects/<id>.ts`, `src/scenes/<id>.tsx`), and `meta.json`'s
  `project` field is what actually resolves the path.
- **Project folders are a server-side column, not part of the project JSON.** One free-text
  folder per project on `projects.folder`, nullable, reported as "Uncategorized" when unset.
  Deliberately *not* an `apply_project_ops` verb: `project.name` is part of the composition
  (title bar, export metadata) whereas a folder describes the stored record, and keeping it
  out of the JSON means an editor save cannot silently reset it. Set it on
  `POST /projects/new`, `POST /projects` or `PUT /projects/:id`; read it everywhere a project
  is returned. See Stage 22.
- **A control test has to be a negative control for the specific mechanism, not just a case
  that happened to work.** Stage 21's report came with one: an earlier project re-exported
  fine on the same code, offered as proof the bug needed an audio track that did not span the
  timeline. It proved nothing — that project's audio covered the whole timeline, so music was
  playing wherever the real cause (a clip's own audio) also played, masking it. The control
  could not distinguish "no bug" from "bug present but masked", which is the one thing a
  control exists to do. Before trusting one, ask: *if the reported mechanism were real, would
  this case actually look different?* If not, it is a coincidence, not evidence. Related:
  the metric traps in Stages 17-19 (a matcher below its noise floor, and ripple falling while
  fidelity fell with it) are the same failure in measurement rather than in controls.
- **Projects created through the MCP server get a `-MCP` suffix, enforced server-side.**
  `create_project` appends it in `apps/mcp-server/src/naming.js` before forwarding to the API,
  so every agent-created project is identifiable in the project list whether or not the calling
  agent knows the rule. An already-suffixed name is not doubled (case-insensitively, and the
  suffix is normalised to `-MCP`), and a missing name becomes `Untitled-MCP` rather than
  project-kit's bare `Untitled`. The render-service API is deliberately left alone — a project
  saved from the editor UI carries no suffix, which is the point. Enforced rather than
  documented because this session lost three agent-side conventions that way (the `-Rep`
  suffix, a shared-assets request, a five-component deletion).
- **Adding or renaming a component touches four places**: `components/<id>/meta.json`,
  `src/projects/<id>.ts`, `src/scenes/<id>.tsx`, plus registration in *both*
  `src/render-harness.ts` (import + `PROJECTS` key, which is the id used by the API and CLI)
  and `vite.config.ts` (the `project:` list).

## Stage 0 — Environment

## Stage 1 — OpenReel Video

Vendored (absorbed fork, nested `.git` removed) into `apps/editor`.

- Upstream: https://github.com/Augani/openreel-video
- Forked at commit: `5f3c85e5fc223c86060bf4b12e1b4dec58e9b8a9` ("chore(deps): align public workspace lockfile")
- License: MIT
- To pull upstream changes later: add it as a remote from the monorepo root and merge with
  `git subtree`, or diff against a fresh clone of that SHA.

OpenReel is itself a pnpm monorepo:
`apps/{web,desktop,image,studio}`, `packages/{core,ui,agent,agent-runner,creation-*,fxpkg,image-core}`.
Editor target = `@openreel/web`. Root `dev` script = `pnpm --filter @openreel/web dev`.
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses `patchedDependencies` for `@ffmpeg/core` and `@ffmpeg/core-mt`
(pnpm-specific -> we stay on pnpm).

### Verified working (Stage 1, real interaction in a Chromium browser)

Dev server: `pnpm --filter @openreel/web dev` -> Vite 5.4.21 on <http://localhost:5173/>. No env vars required.

| Function | How verified |
|---|---|
| Import video | ffmpeg-made 6s 640x360 h264/aac file -> appears in Project Media with thumbnail |
| Add to timeline | double-click media item; prompts "Match Video Dimensions?" (kept 1920x1080) |
| Split | playhead 2s + Split (S) -> 6s clip becomes 1.987s + 2s clips |
| Trim | "Trim end to playhead (W)" at 4s -> second clip shortened to 2.00s |
| Multi-track | 4 track rows; text clip dragged from Video 1 to Track 2, confirmed in project JSON (`textClips[0].trackId`) |
| Export | MP4 2,072,315 bytes, header `ftypisom`, `[export] render=0.5ms/f frames=270` |
| Recovery | page reload -> "We found an unsaved project / 2 older saves available" -> Recover restored everything |

Notes on the environment:

- **WebGPU is unavailable in the embedded Claude browser** (`[WebGPURenderer] No GPU adapter available`
  -> `[RendererFactory] WebGPU init failed, using Canvas2D`). Export still works, CPU-rendered.
- **Export opens a native save dialog** via `showSaveFilePicker()`
  (`apps/web/src/components/editor/Toolbar.tsx:245`), which cannot be driven from automation.
  There is an anchor-download fallback at `apps/web/src/services/export-runner.ts:301` when the
  picker throws anything other than `AbortError`. For automated end-to-end tests, stub
  `window.showSaveFilePicker` with an in-memory writable implementing
  `write` / `seek` / `truncate` / `close` (omitting `seek` fails with `diskWriter.seek is not a function`).
- Only one external network request fires at startup: a Google Fonts stylesheet from `index.html`.
  Mediapipe / Hugging Face model downloads are on-demand only
  (`apps/web/src/services/multicam-face-reactions.ts`). `apps/web/scripts/vendor-fonts.mjs` exists to
  vendor those fonts locally if we want fully offline operation.

### Runtime project state

All paths below are relative to `apps/editor/apps/web/src/` unless noted.

- **`stores/project-store.ts`** (~4,500 lines) is the single Zustand store holding the whole project.
  It is composed from slices in **`stores/project/`**: `clip-slice.ts`, `media-slice.ts`, `track-slice.ts`,
  `timeline-item-slice.ts`, `text-graphics-slice.ts`, `subtitle-slice.ts`, `marker-slice.ts`,
  `history-slice.ts` (undo/redo), plus `project-helpers.ts` / `store-helpers.ts` / `types.ts`.
- Other stores: `stores/timeline-store.ts` (view state: zoom, track heights, playhead),
  `stores/ui-store.ts`, `stores/engine-store.ts` (title/graphics/render engines), `stores/settings-store.ts`.
- **Text, shape, SVG and sticker clips do NOT live in the Zustand project object.** They live in the
  title/graphics engines and are merged in on serialization by `getFullProject()`
  (see `stores/project-store.ts:2957`), which calls `titleEngine.getAllTextClips()`,
  `graphicsEngine.getAllShapeClips()`, etc. Anything needing the complete project must use
  `getFullProject()`, not `state.project`.
- Core domain types live in the workspace package **`packages/core/src/types/`**:
  `project.ts` (`Project`, `MediaItem`, `MediaLibrary`), `timeline.ts` (`Clip`, `Track`, `Effect`, `ClipMetadata`).

### Persistence

Three separate mechanisms, all local, all IndexedDB:

1. **Autosave / crash recovery** — `services/auto-save.ts`.
   IndexedDB `openreel-autosave`, store `autosaves`, version 1. Config at `services/auto-save.ts:28`:
   **30s interval, 2s debounce, 3 rotating slots**, enabled by default.
   The trigger is both timer- and edit-driven: `initializeAutoSave` (`stores/project-store.ts:2953`) starts
   the interval and subscribes to the Zustand `project` selector, calling
   `autoSaveManager.markDirty(getFullProject())` on every project change; the manager debounces 2s and
   skips writes when a content hash is unchanged.
   `serializeProjectForAutoSave()` strips `blob`, `fileHandle`, `waveformData`, `filmstripThumbnails`
   and any `blob:` thumbnail URL before storing. This is what powers the
   "We found an unsaved project / N older saves available" dialog (`checkForRecovery` / `recoverFromAutoSave`).
2. **Named projects + recents** — `services/project-manager.ts`.
   IndexedDB `openreel-projects`, stores `projects` (keyPath `id`) and `recent`.
3. **Media blobs** — `services/media-storage.ts`, delegating to `StorageEngine` from `@openreel/core`.
   Keyed by `mediaId` and `projectId` (`saveMediaBlob` / `loadProjectMedia` / `deleteProjectMedia`),
   plus persisted `FileSystemFileHandle` / directory handles for re-linking files across sessions.
   Recovery re-attaches blobs by `mediaId` after loading the autosaved JSON
   (`recoverFromAutoSave`, `stores/project-store.ts:2988`).

`localStorage` holds only small UI flags: `openreel-onboarding-complete`, `openreel-ui-preferences`,
`openreel-timeline-workspace` (track heights).

### Project JSON: export and import to file — YES, both already exist

The toolbar button **"Project JSON / Comments"** opens `components/editor/ScriptViewDialog.tsx`, which has
three modes: view, **Export JSON** (with `Copy` and `Download JSON` — a real `URL.createObjectURL` +
`a.download` of `<name>_<date>.json`, `ScriptViewDialog.tsx:71-77`) and **Import** (file read or paste,
then `Import Project`, `ScriptViewDialog.tsx:137`). So OpenReel already round-trips a project to a `.json`
file; we do not need to build save/load-to-file ourselves.

Serialization lives in `packages/core/src/storage/project-serializer.ts`:
`exportToJson()` wraps the project as `{ version, capabilities, minimumReaderVersion, project }` and strips
media blobs; `importFromJson()` calls `assertReaderCompatibility(projectFile)` then
`normalizeProjectStoredFields()`. Validation is deliberately lenient — `parseProjectContent`
(`services/project-manager.ts:186`) only requires `project.id` and `project.name` to be strings, and
`normalizeProjectStoredFields` (`project-serializer.ts:204`) only fills in motion/creation/shader defaults.
Everything is spread-based, so **unknown extra fields on clips survive a JSON round-trip**.

### Sample project object

Real export from the Stage 1 test project, saved verbatim at
[`apps/editor/NOTES-sample-project.json`](apps/editor/NOTES-sample-project.json).
That project = one 6s video imported, split at 2s, second half trimmed to 2s, plus one "Heading"
text clip moved onto Track 2.

Top-level shape:

```
{ version, minimumReaderVersion, capabilities[], project: {...}, metadata: { exportedAt, description } }
```

Inside `project`:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`, `name`, `createdAt`, `modifiedAt` | project identity; timestamps are epoch ms |
| `settings` | `width`, `height`, `frameRate`, `sampleRate`, `channels` — the canvas/output spec |
| `mediaLibrary.items[]` | the media library (the "bin"). One entry per imported asset |
| `timeline.tracks[]` | ordered tracks; each has `id`, `type` ("video"), optional `mode`, `name`, `clips[]`, `transitions[]`, `locked`, `hidden`, `muted`, `solo` |
| `timeline.duration` | computed total duration, seconds |
| `timeline.subtitles[]`, `timeline.markers[]` | subtitles and timeline markers |
| `textClips[]`, `shapeClips[]`, `svgClips[]`, `stickerClips[]` | **flat top-level arrays, NOT nested in tracks**; each carries its own `trackId` |
| `motionCompositions[]`, `motionInstances[]`, `generatedShaders[]` | the built-in "Motion Design" mode's data |
| `capabilities[]` | e.g. `"universal-tracks-v1"`; gates whether an older reader may open the file |

A media library item (`mediaLibrary.items[0]`):

- `id` — UUID referenced by clips via `mediaId`. **This is the join key.**
- `name`, `type` (`"video" | "audio" | "image"`).
- `fileHandle: null`, `blob: null` — always stripped in JSON; blobs live in IndexedDB keyed by this `id`.
- `metadata` — `duration`, `width`, `height`, `frameRate`, `codec`, `sampleRate`, `channels`, `fileSize`,
  `hasVideo`, `hasAudio`.
- `thumbnailUrl` — a session-local `blob:` URL (worthless after reload; autosave nulls it out).
- `sourceFile` — `{ name, size, lastModified }`, a hint used to re-match the file in another session or machine.
- `isPlaceholder` — true when the media is referenced but its bytes are missing.
- Precedent worth copying: for AI-generated media the same interface already carries `originalUrl`,
  `isPending`, `kieaiTaskId`, `kieaiError` (`packages/core/src/types/project.ts:57`). Our render-service
  clips can follow exactly that pattern — a URL plus a job id plus a pending flag.

A timeline clip (`timeline.tracks[0].clips[0]`):

- `id`, `mediaId` (-> media library item), `trackId`.
- `startTime` — position on the timeline, seconds.
- `duration` — length on the timeline, seconds.
- `inPoint` / `outPoint` — the source-media in/out, seconds. **Trimming changes these, not the media.**
  In the sample, the split produced clip A `startTime 0, inPoint 0, outPoint 1.9867` and clip B
  `startTime 1.9867, inPoint 1.9867, outPoint 3.9867, duration 2` — both halves still point at the same
  `mediaId`, and B's `outPoint` was pulled in by the trim.
- `effects[]`, `audioEffects[]`, `transform` (`position`, `scale`, `rotation`, `anchor`, `opacity`,
  `fitMode`), `volume`, `keyframes[]`.
- Optional: `speed`, `reversed`, `chromaKey`, `colorGrading`, `blendMode`, `stabilization`, ... and **`metadata`**.

A text clip (`textClips[0]`): `id`, `trackId`, `startTime`, `duration`, `text`, `style`
(`fontFamily`, `fontSize`, `fontWeight`, `color`, `strokeColor`, `textAlign`, ...), `transform`
(position normalized 0..1 here, unlike video clips' pixel offsets), `keyframes[]`.

### What this means for Stage 5 (extending the schema)

`Clip.metadata` is typed as `ClipMetadata` (`packages/core/src/types/timeline.ts:82`), which has an
**open index signature**:

```ts
export interface ClipMetadata {
  readonly templateSource?: EditingTemplateApplicationSource;
  readonly appliedTemplates?: AppliedEditingTemplate[];
  readonly templateManaged?: boolean;
  readonly templateTrackType?: "text" | "graphics";
  readonly [key: string]: unknown;   // <- official extension point
}
```

So the Stage 5 fields fit without touching the core schema at all:

```json
"metadata": {
  "source": "component-library",
  "componentId": "animated-text",
  "props": { "text": "...", "color": "#ffffff", "durationInSeconds": 3 },
  "renderedFileId": "..."
}
```

They survive export/import because the serializer is spread-based and validation is lenient.
Open question for Stage 5: whether to also add our own entry to `capabilities[]`. Doing so makes stock
OpenReel readers refuse the file via `assertReaderCompatibility` — honest, but stricter. Recommendation:
skip it for the prototype.

### Media library / import panel (for Stage 4)

- **`components/editor/AssetsPanel.tsx`** (~1,610 lines) is the whole left panel, mounted once at
  `components/editor/EditorInterface.tsx:483`.
- The left rail's tabs come from the `ASSETS_TABS` array (`AssetsPanel.tsx:62`), with the `AssetsTab`
  union type just above it: `media | text | graphics | effects | transitions | ai | recipes | templates`.
  **Adding a "Component Library" tab = one entry in that union + one entry in `ASSETS_TABS` + one panel body.**
- The "Project Media" grid renders at `AssetsPanel.tsx:1114`; the hidden `<input type="file" multiple>` is
  at `AssetsPanel.tsx:1559` (`accept="video/*,audio/*,image/*"`); drop handling is `onDrop={handleDrop}`
  at `AssetsPanel.tsx:1107`.
- The import entry point to reuse is **`importMedia(file: File)`** from the project store's media slice
  (`stores/project/media-slice.ts:22`), called at `AssetsPanel.tsx:712` and `:959`. Handing it a `File`
  fetched from render-service is the cleanest way to get a rendered component into the library — it handles
  metadata probing, thumbnailing, blob persistence and library insertion for us.

## Motion Design mode vs. our plan

Short focused pass over OpenReel's built-in "Motion Design" mode (the second workspace tab, and the
`motionCompositions` / `motionInstances` fields in the project JSON). Conclusion up front: **it is not
keyframe motion on existing clips — it is a full parameterized animation-composition system that already
does structurally what our Component Library is meant to do.** It is directly relevant, and it changes
the cheapest implementation path for Stage 4/5 (though not the brief we are following).

### What it actually is

A second, After-Effects-shaped editor living in `apps/web/src/motion/` (`MotionCreatorApp.tsx`,
`MotionCreatorShell.tsx`) with layer panel, graph editor, masks, deform, effects/shaders, animation
presets, camera, lights, motion blur and its own render queue. Types are in
`packages/core/src/motion/types.ts` (~1,100 lines).

Two-level data model, mirroring After Effects' comp/instance split:

- **`MotionComposition`** (`packages/core/src/motion/types.ts:1054`) — the reusable definition:
  `id`, `name`, `width`, `height`, `frameRate`, `duration`, `backgroundColor`, `layers[]`, `assets[]`,
  `fonts[]`, `markers[]`, `camera`, and — the interesting part — **`variables: MotionVariable[]`**.
- **`MotionVariable`** (`types.ts:990`) — `{ id, name, type, value }` where
  `type: "text" | "number" | "color" | "boolean" | "media"`. That is essentially our planned
  `meta.json` param schema, already in the codebase.
- **`MotionCompositionInstance`** (`types.ts:1081`) — a placement of a composition on a main-timeline
  track: `compositionId`, `trackId`, `startTime`, `duration`, `transform`, `opacity`, `blendMode`,
  and **`variableOverrides: Record<string, string | number | boolean>`**.

So: definition + per-instance parameter overrides + timeline placement. Compare with our Stage 5 target
(`componentId` + `props` + timing) — it is the same shape, with `compositionId` ~ `componentId` and
`variableOverrides` ~ `props`.

### It renders live, not to a file

Instances are composited **per frame** into the main editor timeline, not pre-rendered into a media file.
`Preview.tsx:1821` filters `project.motionInstances` by `trackId` and the current time window and hands
each to a `MotionRenderer`. `variableOverrides` is genuinely honored by the render path — it is threaded
through `packages/core/src/motion/motion-renderer.ts:165`, `motion-render-order.ts:72` and
`motion-gpu-render.ts:161`. There is no intermediate webm; a composition is re-rendered from its layer
graph on every frame draw.

This is the fundamental architectural difference from our plan, which pre-renders each component to a
`webm` with alpha and treats the result as ordinary media.

### Is there a shortcut for Stage 4?

Partly — the store layer, yes; the UI, no.

- **Reusable:** `insertMotionInstance(compositionId, placement?)`
  (`apps/web/src/stores/project-store.ts:3456`, typed at `stores/project/types.ts:250`) does exactly what a
  library panel needs: place a parameterized composition on a track at a given `startTime`/`duration`.
  There are matching `removeMotionInstance`, `getMotionComposition`, `getMotionInstance` actions, and
  motion actions are wired into undo/redo via `packages/core/src/actions/handlers/motion.ts`.
- **Not reusable:** there is **no library/browser UI** for it. The only caller of `insertMotionInstance`
  is `MotionCreatorShell.tsx:666` — a "Use in editor" button inside the Motion Design workspace, which
  places the composition you are currently authoring. You author a comp by hand, then push it to the
  timeline. There is no "pick from a catalogue" panel to mirror.
- **Also missing:** despite `variableOverrides` existing in the type and being honored by the renderer,
  **no UI writes it** — a grep for `variableOverrides` across `apps/web/src/**/*.tsx` returns nothing.
  So per-instance parameter editing is data-model-only today. (`TemplateVariablesPanel.tsx` is a different
  feature — project-template variables, not motion variables.)

Net: for Stage 4 we would still build the panel and the parameter form ourselves either way. What the
motion path would save is the render service, the queue and the file storage; what it would cost is
writing components as OpenReel `MotionLayer` graphs instead of Motion Canvas scenes.

### Conflicts with our plan

- **No conflict on storage or in-repo assumptions.** Compositions are plain project data stored in the
  project JSON (and IndexedDB) — user-authored at runtime, not compiled into the repo. Nothing expects a
  fixed in-repo catalogue, so nothing blocks fetching assets from an external service.
- **No conflict on our chosen approach.** Our render-service clips arrive as normal media library items +
  ordinary `Clip`s carrying `metadata.componentId` / `props` / `renderedFileId`. That path does not touch
  `motionCompositions` / `motionInstances` at all — the two systems sit side by side without interfering.
- **One real tension, worth naming:** we are about to build a second, parallel mechanism for
  "parameterized reusable animated component on the timeline" when the host app already has one. The
  duplication is deliberate (the brief specifies Motion Canvas, and Motion Canvas gives us a real
  animation DSL, headless CLI rendering, and alpha-channel webm output that survives outside this editor),
  but it is duplication.
- **Practical trade-offs of the two paths**, for the record:
  - *Our plan (Motion Canvas + render service):* components are authored in TypeScript with a proper
    animation library; rendering is headless and reproducible; output is a portable file. Costs: a
    service, a Redis queue, render latency before a clip appears, and re-render on every parameter change.
  - *Motion Design instances:* zero infrastructure, instant parameter changes, live compositing, undo/redo
    already wired. Costs: components must be expressed as OpenReel motion layer graphs (no external DSL),
    they only exist inside OpenReel, and we would be building on a large in-repo subsystem we did not write
    and would have to learn.

**Decision taken:** proceed with Stage 2 as briefed (Motion Canvas + render service). Recorded here so the
alternative is a deliberate rejection rather than an oversight — if render latency turns out to be the
prototype's main friction, `insertMotionInstance` + `variableOverrides` is the escape hatch.

### Direct comparison: native Motion Design vs. external Motion Canvas + render-service

**1. Live or baked?** Both, on separate paths — and this is a point in its favour.

- *On the main timeline:* strictly **live, per-frame, never baked.** `Preview.tsx:1821` filters
  `project.motionInstances` by `trackId` + time window and renders each through `MotionRenderer` on every
  frame draw. Equivalent to a Remotion Player: parameter changes are instant, nothing is written to disk.
- *Engine:* primary path is **`OffscreenCanvas` 2D** (`motion-renderer.ts:633`, `getContext("2d")`).
  An optional **WebGPU** compositor handles layer blending when available
  (`motion-gpu-compositor.ts:331`, `getContext("webgpu")`, with WGSL blend shaders from
  `motion-gpu-blend.ts`) behind a `preferGpu` flag; it falls back to Canvas2D otherwise.
  Adjustment layers, track mattes and backdrop-blur force the Canvas2D compositing path
  (`compositionRequiresCanvas2dCompositing`, `motion-gpu-render.ts:28`). 3D (`scene3d`) layers use
  **WebGL** internally (`motion-renderer.ts:756`). So: Canvas2D by default, WebGPU compositing when the
  GPU allows, WebGL for 3D. In our embedded-browser environment WebGPU is unavailable, so Canvas2D.
- *It can also bake:* Motion Design has its own render queue (`apps/web/src/motion/render-queue-runner.ts`
  -> `exportMotionCompositionScene`) whose formats (`export-motion-frame.ts:64`,
  `MOTION_EXPORT_FORMATS`) are: `mp4` (H.264), **`webm-alpha` — "WebM (VP9, transparent)"**,
  `mov-prores4444` (transparent) and `png-sequence` (transparent ZIP), with resolution scaling and a
  frame range. **That is exactly the deliverable Stage 2 was going to build a Node service to produce,
  and it already exists client-side.**

**2. Can a composition be authored as arbitrary code?** **No.** This is the real constraint.

- `MotionLayerType` (`packages/core/src/motion/types.ts:20`) is a **closed union of ten types**:
  `text | shape | image | video | group | null | composition | adjustment | particle | scene3d`.
  There is no "custom code" or "custom component" layer type. A composition is a declarative JSON layer
  graph in OpenReel's own schema, authored through the Motion Design UI.
- Two genuine code escape hatches exist, but neither is component-level authoring:
  - **Per-property expressions.** `MotionExpression.code` (`types.ts:575`) holds a JS snippet, compiled via
    a `Function`-style compiler with `"use strict"` and cached (`motion-expressions.ts:544`), with
    After-Effects-like helpers (default example: `value + wiggle(2, 20)`). This animates *one property*,
    it does not define a component.
  - **Custom GLSL.** `MotionShaderDef` (`packages/core/src/motion/shaders/types.ts`) carries raw `glsl`
    plus typed params (`number | color`) and an `origin: "builtin" | "generated"`. Real shader code, but
    scoped to fills/effects on a layer.
- **Portability verdict:** a composition is meaningful only to OpenReel's renderer. There is no
  composition import/export to a standalone file (no `importComposition`/`exportComposition` anywhere in
  `apps/web/src/motion/`); comps live inside the project JSON. Authoring components natively means our
  component library becomes fork-specific data with no life outside this editor — precisely the coupling
  the external render-service was chosen to avoid. Motion Canvas scenes, by contrast, are ordinary
  TypeScript in a standalone repo that renders to a file usable by any editor.

**3. Recommendation: keep the external Motion Canvas + render-service plan.** Reasoning, weighted:

- The decisive factor is (2), not (1). Live rendering and transparent-webm output are both *better* in the
  native path — but component **authoring** is locked to a proprietary declarative schema with a
  GUI-first workflow. Our components (`animated-text`, `logo-reveal`, `color-transition`) are code
  artifacts we want to version, review, parameterize and reuse; as OpenReel layer graphs they would be
  hand-built in a UI and stored as project JSON, with no path to any other tool.
- The brief's stated rationale (portability, MIT-licensed external engine, self-hosted rendering) is
  satisfied only by the external path. Pivoting would silently trade the prototype's main design goal for
  short-term convenience.
- What we knowingly give up: instant parameter feedback (we re-render on every prop change), and the
  infrastructure cost of a service plus Redis queue. Both are acceptable for a prototype and were
  budgeted in the original architecture.
- Two concrete borrowings from the native system, at no cost to portability:
  - Mirror `MotionVariable`'s param typing (`"text" | "number" | "color" | "boolean" | "media"`,
    `types.ts:990`) in our `meta.json` schema instead of inventing our own vocabulary.
  - Keep `insertMotionInstance` + `variableOverrides` documented as the escape hatch if render latency
    becomes the prototype's dominant friction — the store action, undo/redo wiring and live renderer are
    already there, so a later pivot stays cheap.
- Also worth stealing regardless of path: their `webm-alpha` encoder settings, as a cross-check that our
  Motion Canvas CLI output (VP9 + alpha) matches what this editor imports cleanly.

## Stage 2 — Motion Canvas components

Motion Canvas 3.17.2 (MIT, as are `@motion-canvas/2d`, `/ui`, `/vite-plugin`, `/ffmpeg`).
`packages/component-library/` is a standalone npm project — it has its own `node_modules` and is not
part of any pnpm workspace, so it can be lifted out of this repo unchanged.

### Layout

```
packages/component-library/
  components/<id>/meta.json     param schema per component (what the UI reads)
  src/projects/<id>.ts          makeProject() + defaults, one project per component
  src/scenes/<id>.tsx           the animation itself
  src/lib/props.ts              prop injection (URL query, then VITE_COMPONENT_PROPS)
  src/render-harness.ts         headless render driver (runs in the browser)
  render-harness.html           page the headless browser loads
  scripts/render.mjs            CLI: props in, transparent webm out
  output/                       scratch PNG frames (gitignored)
```

### Param schema

`meta.json` `type` values deliberately reuse OpenReel's `MotionVariable` vocabulary
(`packages/core/src/motion/types.ts:990`): **`text | number | color | boolean | media`**.
So `text` (not "string") for strings. This keeps the format compatible with the
`insertMotionInstance` + `variableOverrides` fallback described above, should we ever switch.
Each `meta.json` also names its `project` file and which param is the duration
(`durationParam`), so the UI can set clip length without hardcoding key names.

### Rendering: there is no Motion Canvas CLI

Worth recording because the original plan assumed one. Findings:

- Motion Canvas ships **no CLI binary** (`npm view @motion-canvas/core bin` -> none). Rendering is
  designed to run in a browser, driven by the editor UI.
- `@motion-canvas/ffmpeg` **cannot produce alpha**: its exporter hardcodes MP4 and
  `-pix_fmt yuv420p` (`node_modules/@motion-canvas/ffmpeg/lib/server/FFmpegExporterServer.js:64-65`).
- The built-in image-sequence exporter (`@motion-canvas/core/image-sequence`) **does** keep alpha, but
  it only works with a Vite dev server: it ships each frame over the HMR channel
  (`import.meta.hot.send('motion-canvas:export', ...)`) and the Vite plugin writes the PNGs to disk.

So `scripts/render.mjs` builds the pipeline the missing CLI would have provided:

1. start a Vite dev server programmatically (random port);
2. launch **headless Chrome** via `puppeteer-core` (Apache-2.0, no bundled Chromium download — it uses
   the system Chrome/Edge; override with `CHROME_PATH`);
3. load `render-harness.html?project=<id>&props=<json>&fps=&width=&height=`, which constructs
   `new Renderer(project)` and calls `render()` with `background: null` and the image-sequence exporter;
4. Vite writes `output/<id>/000000.png` … (PNG, alpha preserved);
5. our own ffmpeg muxes them: `libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -b:v 0 -crf 28 -auto-alt-ref 0`,
   matching OpenReel's own `webm-alpha` export target;
6. delete the PNG scratch frames (`--keep-frames` to keep them).

Exact command:

```bash
node scripts/render.mjs --component animated-text \
  --props '{"text":"Ship it","color":"#ffcc00","durationInSeconds":2}' \
  --out ../../storage/rendered/demo.webm
```

Flags: `--component --props --out --fps (30) --width (1920) --height (1080) --keep-frames`.
Everything is local: Vite, Chrome, ffmpeg. No API keys, no cloud.

### The three components render, verified

| Component | Props used | Frames | Output | Peak mean alpha |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `animated-text` | text "Stage 2", `#ffcc00`, 2s | 61 @30fps | 104,110 B | 2.99 (small glyph coverage) |
| `logo-reveal` | `#22d3ee`, 2.5s | 89 @30fps | 52,916 B | 20.96 (badge covers more) |
| `color-transition` | `#ef4444` -> `#3b82f6`, 1.5s | 46 @30fps | 12,302 B | 255 (full-frame overlay) |

All three: VP9, 1920x1080, WebM tag `alpha_mode=1`. Verified with
`ffprobe -show_entries stream_tags=alpha_mode` and by measuring the alpha plane frame by frame:

```bash
ffmpeg -c:v libvpx-vp9 -i file.webm \
  -vf "alphaextract,signalstats,metadata=print:key=lavfi.signalstats.YAVG:file=-" -f null -
```

For `animated-text` the mean alpha traces the animation exactly: 0 -> 2.99 (hold) -> 1.05 -> 0.

### Alpha compatibility with OpenReel: import works, compositing does NOT

This was checked before building anything on top of it, and it turned up a real problem.

**What works.** OpenReel imports the file cleanly. Its probe of `animated-text.webm` read
`codec vp9, 1920x1080, duration 2.033333, frameRate 30, hasVideo true, hasAudio false`,
`isPlaceholder` false — all correct. The clip behaves like any other: it lands in the media library,
drops on a track, trims, and exports.

**What does not.** **OpenReel's decode path drops the alpha channel.** Stacked
`animated-text` (top track) over the opaque `color-transition` (lower track) and exported: at a time
where both clips are live, the frame shows the text glyphs at exactly `255,204,0` — and everywhere
else **pure black**, not the layer underneath. The reverse stacking gave the mirror image: the opaque
clip covered the text entirely. So each video layer is composited opaquely; a transparent region
becomes black.

**The file is not at fault.** The same webm decoded through a plain `<video>` element in the same
browser and drawn to a 2D canvas gives corner RGBA `(0,0,0,0)` — fully transparent — with only 220
non-transparent pixels across the centre row (the glyphs). Chrome decodes our alpha correctly;
OpenReel's pipeline is what loses it. Cause: OpenReel extracts frames through WebCodecs/mediabunny
(`packages/core/src/video/video-engine.ts`, no `alpha` handling anywhere in it), and VP9 alpha in WebM
lives in per-block side data that WebCodecs does not reconstruct. Note the asymmetry: OpenReel can
*encode* `webm-alpha` but cannot *decode* it.

Useful adjacent finding: **track order is reversed for rendering** —
`getVisibleTrackRenderOrder` (`packages/core/src/timeline/timeline-items.ts:62-68`) reverses the
array, so **"Video 1" (index 0) is the topmost layer**, not the bottom one. Also, "Add to timeline"
inserts at the playhead, not at 0.

### Gotchas to remember during Stage 4 manual testing

Small, but each one will waste an hour if forgotten:

- **"Video 1" is the TOP layer, not the bottom.** `getVisibleTrackRenderOrder`
  (`packages/core/src/timeline/timeline-items.ts:62-68`) reverses the track array before rendering,
  so track index 0 composites last, i.e. on top. A component dropped on "Video 1" covers everything
  below it.
- **"Add to timeline" inserts at the playhead, not at 0.** Two clips added one after another both
  landed at 0.9s because that is where the playhead happened to sit. Park the playhead at 0 before
  testing, or expect offsets.
- Hovering a media card is what reveals its per-item **"Add to timeline" / "Delete"** buttons; they
  are not in the DOM until then. Double-clicking a card adds it too, but only via real pointer events.
- The preview canvas does not repaint while the browser pane is hidden, so pixels sampled from it can
  be stale. Export a frame instead when you need deterministic output.

**Options for Stage 4** (needs a product decision, none blocks Stage 3):

1. *Patch the fork's decode path* — draw alpha-carrying WebM clips from an `HTMLVideoElement` instead
   of WebCodecs frames (proven above to preserve alpha) for clips whose media is tagged
   `alpha_mode=1`. Contained change, keeps the architecture and true transparency. Most work.
2. *Chroma key* — render components over a green background and lean on OpenReel's existing per-clip
   `chromaKey` / green-screen feature (`Clip.chromaKey`, `GreenScreenSection.tsx`). Zero core changes,
   works today, but edge quality suffers and it is a hack.
3. *Accept opaque components* for the prototype — put them on the top track with their own designed
   background. Cheapest, but gives up the overlay use case that motivates the library.
4. *Switch to the native motion path* — `insertMotionInstance` + `variableOverrides` renders live with
   real alpha and never touches a decoder. Trades away the portability that justified Motion Canvas
   (see the Motion Design section above); still the documented fallback if the decode patch proves
   expensive or render latency bites.

Recommendation: keep Stage 3 as planned (nothing here affects the render-service), and take option 1
at Stage 4 with option 2 as the fallback if the patch turns out to be larger than it looks.

## Stage 3 — render-service

Fastify 5.12.3 + BullMQ 6.3.4 (both MIT) in `apps/render-service`, Redis 7-alpine from
`infra/docker-compose.yml`. Storage is the local filesystem (`storage/rendered/`) — no object store.

### Shape

```
apps/render-service/
  src/config.js      paths + env-var configuration
  src/components.js  reads packages/component-library/components/*/meta.json, validates props
  src/queue.js       BullMQ queue + BullMQ-state -> API-status mapping
  src/server.js      HTTP API (producer)
  src/worker.js      queue consumer; shells out to the Stage 2 render script
  test/render-e2e.test.js
```

Server and worker are **separate processes**: a render holds a headless Chrome and an ffmpeg for tens
of seconds, and the API has to stay responsive. Redis is bound to `127.0.0.1:6379` only — it is a
local dev queue, not a network service.

### API

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | service + Redis status; **503** when Redis is unreachable, with the compose command as a hint |
| `GET` | `/components` | the catalogue, straight from each `meta.json` (this is what the Stage 4 panel will list) |
| `POST` | `/render` | `{ componentId, props, fps?, width?, height? }` -> `202 { jobId, status: "pending", props }` |
| `GET` | `/render/:jobId` | `{ status, progress, … }`; when done also `file`, `url`, `bytes`, `frames`, `durationInSeconds` |
| `GET` | `/files/:name.webm` | streams the rendered file (this is how the editor will pull it into its media library) |

Status values are exactly the four the plan asked for. BullMQ's richer state set is collapsed in
`toApiStatus()`: `waiting | delayed | prioritized | paused | waiting-children` -> `pending`,
`active` -> `processing`, `completed` -> `done`, `failed` -> `failed`.

Props are validated against the component's `meta.json` *before* a job is queued — unknown keys are
dropped and echoed back as `ignoredProps`, missing keys take their defaults, numbers are range-checked
against `min`/`max`, colours must be hex. Bad input gets a `400` listing every problem, so the Stage 4
form can show them inline. The validator switches on the same `MotionVariable` type vocabulary the
`meta.json` files use (`text | number | color | boolean | media`).

### Worker

The worker does **not** reimplement the render pipeline: it spawns
`packages/component-library/scripts/render.mjs` with `--component`, `--props`, `--out`, `--fps`,
`--width`, `--height`, and writes to `storage/rendered/<jobId>.webm`. That script is already verified
(Stage 2) to produce a correct alpha channel, so reusing it keeps one implementation of the
Vite + Chrome + ffmpeg chain. The worker adds a kill-switch timeout (`RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS`, default
10 min), progress updates, an empty-file guard, and parses the frame count out of the script's stdout.

Concurrency defaults to 1 (`WORKER_CONCURRENCY`).

### Configuration

All optional env vars: `PORT` (3001), `HOST` (127.0.0.1), `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `QUEUE_NAME`,
`RENDER_STORAGE_DIR`, `COMPONENT_LIBRARY_DIR`, `WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, `RENDER_TIMEOUT_MS`,
`RENDER_FPS`, `RENDER_WIDTH`, `RENDER_HEIGHT`, `LOG_LEVEL`.

### Three snags worth remembering (all fixed)

1. **`node --test test/` does not work here.** With a directory argument Node 22.14 on Windows tried
   to `require` the directory as a module and died with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND: ...	est`. The script is
   now `node --test test/*.test.js`.
2. **BullMQ 6 made `ioredis` an optional dependency.** Without it both server and worker threw
   `BullMQ could not load the optional 'ioredis' package` at import time, so the server never listened.
   `ioredis` (MIT) is now an explicit dependency.
3. **BullMQ 6 removed `queue.client`.** It resolves to `undefined` (the raw Redis client moved behind
   the backend abstraction, per `queue-base.d.ts`), so the old `queue.client.ping()` health check always
   reported Redis down. Readiness is now `queue.waitUntilReady()` raced against a 2s timeout, because it
   otherwise hangs while ioredis retries.

Also: killing a test run with Ctrl+C (or a task kill) leaves the spawned server and worker alive, and
the next run then fails with `EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:3199`. The test now checks the port is free up
front and reports a dead child's exit code, instead of blaming it on an unhealthy service.

### Test

`npm test` in `apps/render-service` (node:test): lists the catalogue and asserts every param type is
in the MotionVariable vocabulary, rejects an unknown component (404) and bad props (400 with two
specific messages), then renders `animated-text` with custom text through the real API — polling
`/render/:jobId` until it settles — and asserts the file exists, is non-empty, matches the reported
byte count, downloads over HTTP as `video/webm`, and starts with WebM's EBML magic bytes
(`1A 45 DF A3`). Requires Redis, ffmpeg and Chrome.

Result: **5/5 passing, exit 0, ~7.7s** end to end (`processing -> done`; `pending` is usually too brief
to observe). The rendered file was `102,273 bytes, 40 frames`, and `ffprobe` confirms the file the API
produced still carries alpha: `vp9,1920,1080` with `alpha_mode=1`. `KEEP_TEST_OUTPUT=1` keeps it for
inspection.

## Stage 4 — Component Library panel in OpenReel

Alpha decision for this stage: **chroma key (option 2)**, not patching the decode path. No
core-engine changes, works today, and gives a real visual overlay. Patching WebCodecs for
`alpha_mode=1` stays a post-Stage-6 follow-up.

### Chroma-key rendering

`scripts/render.mjs` gained `--background <hex>`; the transparent mode is untouched and still the
default. With a background the harness passes it to Motion Canvas as the stage `background` (instead
of `null`), and ffmpeg encodes `yuv420p` rather than `yuva420p` — the alpha plane is pointless once
the frames carry a backdrop, and the file is smaller (39 KB vs 102 KB for a comparable clip).

`#00ff00` is not arbitrary: it matches OpenReel's own chroma default, `keyColor { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0 }`
(`GreenScreenSection.tsx:124`). Verified on a rendered frame — background exactly `(0,255,0)`,
glyphs `(255,255,255)`.

`POST /render` takes an optional `background` (validated as hex), threads it through the job to the
worker's `--background`, and echoes it on the job status. The panel always asks for `#00ff00`.

### The panel

`apps/editor/apps/web/src/components/editor/panels/ComponentLibraryPanel.tsx`, wired into
`AssetsPanel.tsx` at exactly the four points mapped in Stage 1: the `AssetsTab` union, `ASSETS_TABS`,
`TAB_ICONS` (added `Boxes`), and the `renderSectionContent` switch. Nothing else in that file changed.
`tsc --noEmit` on `@openreel/web` is clean.

Flow: `GET /components` -> card grid -> form generated from the param schema (`text`/`media` -> text
input, `color` -> colour picker, `number` -> range + readout, `boolean` -> checkbox) -> **Generate**
-> `POST /render` -> poll `GET /render/:jobId` once a second -> download the file -> hand it to the
store's existing `importMedia(file)`. Button text tracks the phase (Queued / Rendering N% / Adding to
media), errors surface inline and as a toast, and if the service is unreachable the panel says so and
offers Retry plus the commands to start it. Service URL overridable with `VITE_RENDER_SERVICE_URL`
(default `http://127.0.0.1:3001`).

### Manual test — works end to end

Generated `animated-text` with the text "Stage 4 works" from the panel: job 3 rendered in ~20s and
landed in the media library as `animated-text-Stage 4 works.webm` (75,415 bytes, 00:02), behaving like
any other clip. Placed it on **Video 1** (the top layer) with a blue-to-pink gradient clip on
**Video 2** underneath, then applied Chroma Key.

Measured from OpenReel's own MP4 export, sampling the centre row of the frame:

| time | what is live | green px | white px | background pixel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0s, before keying | both clips | 1467 | 405 | `(0,255,1)` — green covers the layer below |
| 1.0s, after keying | both clips | **0** | 438 | `(233,62,119)` — the gradient shows through |
| 4.0s, after keying | gradient only | 0 | 0 | `(233,62,119)` |

The editor's live preview agrees: white "Stage 4 works" over the gradient, no green anywhere, no
visible fringing at preview scale.

### Two things about OpenReel's chroma-key UI

1. **The Green Screen section's Enable switch does not affect rendering.** `handleToggleEnabled`
   (`GreenScreenSection.tsx:141`) only mutates the in-memory `ChromaKeyEngine` and bumps
   `project.modifiedAt`; unlike the colour/tolerance handlers it never dispatches
   `clip/setChromaKey`, so `clip.chromaKey` stays undefined and the export is unaffected. Toggling it
   changed nothing in the output — confirmed by exporting and sampling pixels.
2. **The path that works is the Chroma Key *effect*.** Select the clip, open Effects, and
   **double-click** the "Chroma Key" card (its own label says "or double-click to apply to selected
   clip"). That writes `clip.effects[] = [{ type: "chromaKey", enabled: true, params: {} }]`, which the
   render path honours. Default params key out green at 30% tolerance — good enough as-is.

For Stage 5/6 automation: the inspector accordions are `div[role="button"]`, not `<button>` elements,
so `querySelectorAll("button")` misses them entirely — select by `aria-label` instead
(`Expand … section` / `Collapse … section`).

## Stage 5 — component metadata and re-render

### Where the metadata lives

On `clip.metadata`, via the `ClipMetadata` index signature found in Stage 1 — **no core schema
change**:

```json
"metadata": {
  "source": "component-library",
  "componentId": "animated-text",
  "props": { "text": "Persisted swap", "color": "#ffffff", "durationInSeconds": 2 },
  "renderedFileId": "6.webm",
  "background": "#00ff00"
}
```

`background` is recorded so a re-render reproduces the same chroma backdrop rather than assuming the
current default.

### How it gets there

The panel imports the rendered file, but the *clip* only exists once the user drops that media on a
track — so `services/component-library-clips.ts` bridges the gap:

- `registerGeneratedMedia(mediaId, info)` records mediaId -> component info, mirrored into
  `localStorage` (`openreel-component-library-media`) so a reload before placement does not lose it;
- a single store subscription stamps `clip.metadata` on any clip referencing registered media that
  does not carry it yet — idempotent, so it is safe on every store change;
- `updateClipMetadata(clipId, patch)` merges into one clip's metadata by spreading the clip, so
  `effects`, `transform` and trim points are carried over untouched. Written straight to the store
  because there is no `clip/setMetadata` action; `GreenScreenSection` mutates store state the same way.

### Round-trip: confirmed, no re-render

Generated `animated-text` ("Round trip"), placed it, applied Chroma Key, waited for autosave, reloaded
the page and hit Recover:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| `clip.metadata` after reload | all five fields intact |
| `clip.effects` after reload | `["chromaKey"]` |
| media restored | `animated-text-Round trip.webm`, `isPlaceholder: false` |
| calls to render-service after reload | **none** (`performance` resource list has no `:3001` entries) |
| render-service job counter | `4` before reload, `4` after — nothing re-rendered |

### Re-render: effects survive

`handleRegenerate` uses **`replaceMediaAsset(clip.mediaId, file)`**, which swaps the bytes behind the
*existing* mediaId. The clip object is never rebuilt, so effects/transform/trim/position survive by
construction rather than by copying them across. Verified on a clip that already had Chroma Key:

| check | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| clip id | `b3010207-…` | `b3010207-…` (same) |
| mediaId | `17f787fb-…` | `17f787fb-…` (same) |
| `effects` | `[chromaKey enabled]` | `[chromaKey enabled]` |
| `metadata.props.text` | "Round trip" | "Re-rendered OK" |
| `renderedFileId` | `4.webm` | `5.webm` |
| `startTime` / `duration` / `inPoint` / `outPoint` | 0 / 2.033 / 0 / 2.033 | unchanged |

And the keying still works — sampled from OpenReel's own export at 1.0s, centre row:
**0 green pixels**, background `(233,62,119)` (the gradient underneath), 462 white glyph pixels; at
4.0s (component clip ended) pure gradient. The UI reports it too: "1 effect kept on the clip."

### Two bugs found while testing

1. **`replaceMediaAsset` never persists the new blob — fixed in our flow.** It updates the in-memory
   media item but calls no `saveMediaBlob` (the only call in `media-slice.ts` is inside `importMedia`).
   Consequence: the re-render looked right until a reload, after which recovery re-attached the
   *previous* bytes and the clip showed the old text while its metadata described the new one.
   `handleRegenerate` now writes the blob itself after the swap. Re-tested end to end: re-rendered to
   "Persisted swap", waited for autosave, reloaded, recovered — preview and export both show the new
   render, and the export still keys (0 green, 462 white).
2. **The preview does not apply clip effects after a media swap, or after loading a project.** This one
   is pre-existing OpenReel behaviour, not caused by the swap: on a freshly recovered project whose
   clip carries `effects: [chromaKey]`, the preview shows the raw green while **the export of that very
   same project keys correctly** (0 green). Dispatching `openreel:preview-invalidate` (the convention
   other inspector sections use) does not help; scrubbing the playhead does not help. The effect
   appears to be registered with the preview's effect pipeline only when applied through the UI in that
   session.

   Consequence for Stage 6: after a reload the demo's live preview will show green even though the
   project is correct. Either re-apply the Chroma Key effect in-session before demoing the preview, or
   demo the exported file. Worth a follow-up alongside the alpha decode patch — both are preview/decode
   plumbing in the same area.

## Stage 6 — end-to-end scenario

Run against a genuinely fresh project, driven through the real UI in a Chromium browser. Project id
`c9ca4e44-970c-4255-8a6c-fc5db510f8e7`.

| # | Step | Verified how | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create a new project | real interaction — Start Fresh -> Create Horizontal project | empty library ("No media imported"), 1920x1080 |
| 2 | Import a video, trim it | real interaction — file input, Add to timeline, **Trim end to playhead (W)** at 4.0s | 6s source -> clip `0 - 4.00s`, `outPoint 4.00` |
| 3 | Generate `animated-text` | real interaction — Component Library, text "End to end", 2s, Generate | job 7 -> `7.webm`, appeared in Project Media |
| 4 | Second track, sync timing, Chroma Key | real interaction — Add to timeline at playhead 1s, then the Effects **Chroma Key card (double-click)** | component on **Video 1** (top) `1.00 - 3.03s`, video on **Video 2** `0 - 4.00s`, `effects: [chromaKey]` |
| 5 | Save the project | real interaction — autosave (this build has no explicit Save button; persistence is autosave + Project JSON download) | 3 rotating autosave slots for this project id, newest 3,443 B |
| 6 | Reload and reopen | real interaction — full page reload -> "We found an unsaved project" -> Recover Project | same project id; component `start 1.00`, `effects [chromaKey]`, full metadata (`componentId`, `props`, `renderedFileId 7.webm`, `background #00ff00`); both media restored, neither a placeholder |
| 7 | Export the final video | real interaction — Export (MP4 preset), captured through an in-page writable stub | **1,976,509 bytes**, header `ftypisom`, **1920x1080**, **4.00s** |

### Export frame verification

Sampled the centre row of the exported MP4 — the source of truth for this stage, since the live
preview is affected by the known reload bug:

| time | what should be live | green px | white px | background pixel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5s | footage only (component starts at 1s) | 0 | 0 | `(233,62,119)` |
| 2.0s | footage + component | **0** | **356** | `(233,62,119)` |
| 3.6s | footage only (component ended at 3.03s) | 0 | 0 | `(233,62,119)` |

Zero green anywhere, the gradient footage visible behind the text, and white glyph pixels present only
while the component clip is live. The compositing is correct in the exported file.

### Preview screenshot

With the Chroma Key effect re-applied in-session (the documented workaround for the reload bug), the
live preview at 2.0s shows white "End to end" over the blue-to-pink gradient, no green. That extra
effect application was undone afterwards, so the saved project still carries exactly one
`chromaKey` effect.

**Definition of Done met**: the scenario reproduces locally with no manual file edits between steps,
everything lives in one git repository, and the root `README.md` documents running it from scratch.

## Stage 7 — alpha fixed in export; the preview-effects fix failed and was reverted

### The earlier diagnosis was wrong in one direction

Stages 2 and 5 concluded "OpenReel drops the alpha channel". That was inferred from the *export*
only, then generalised. Tested properly — a transparent VP9 clip on Video 1 over gradient footage on
Video 2, no chroma key:

- **Preview composited the alpha clip correctly all along** (yellow glyphs over the gradient, no black
  box). Preview's own decode path builds an `HTMLVideoElement` (`Preview.tsx`, `decodeClipFrame`), and
  `createImageBitmap(video)` keeps the alpha.
- **Export rendered it as an opaque black rectangle** covering the footage: at 1.0s the centre row had
  1701 black pixels, 15 gradient, 204 yellow.

So alpha was an **export-path** problem and the effects-reapplication is a **preview-path** problem —
the mirror image of what Stages 2/5 assumed.

### Fix that landed: one option, in the export decoder

`ExportFrameDecoder` (`packages/core/src/media/mediabunny-engine.ts:113`) built its sink as
`new CanvasSink(videoTrack, { poolSize: 2 })`. mediabunny's own docs for the option it omits
(`media-sink.d.ts`, `CanvasSinkOptions`):

> `alpha?: boolean` — "Whether the output canvases should have transparency instead of a black
> background. Defaults to `false`. Set this to `true` when using this sink to read transparent videos."

Default `false` means `getContext('2d', { alpha: false })`, which bakes black behind every frame.
mediabunny *does* decode VP9 alpha side data (it has a `u_alphaTexture` WebGL path), so nothing was
missing upstream — the flag was simply never passed. Adding `alpha: true` is the entire fix.

Verified, same project and timestamps, before -> after:

| sample | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5s black pixels (centre row) | 1701 | **0** |
| 1.5s gradient pixels | 15 | **1711** |
| 1.5s yellow glyph pixels | 204 | 209 |
| 3.5s (alpha clip ended) | gradient, clean | gradient, clean |

**Regression check on the chroma path** (Stage 4/6's mechanism, an opaque clip keyed with the Chroma
Key effect): export still correct — 0 green, 0 black, gradient visible behind 439 white glyph pixels.
Preview also still renders normally. `alpha: true` is a no-op for opaque content.

Consequence: **true transparency now works end to end**, so chroma keying is no longer required. The
panel still renders on `#00ff00` because that path is what Stages 4-6 verified; switching it is a
one-line change (`CHROMA_BACKGROUND` -> `null` in `ComponentLibraryPanel.tsx`, and drop the
`background` from the render request), and would remove keying artefacts — but it needs the Stage 5/6
flows re-verified before being made the default.

### Fix that did NOT work: hydrating the effects bridge (reverted)

Root cause of the preview bug was found and is not in doubt. `applyEffectsToFrame`
(`components/editor/preview/canvas-renderers.ts:1769`) reads a clip's effects from
**`effectsBridge.getEffects(clipId)`** — an in-memory `Map` populated only by `applyVideoEffect()`
when an effect is applied through the UI — while the export reads `clip.effects` off the project
(`video-engine.ts:788`). Hence: correct in-session, wrong after a reload, export always fine.

The obvious fix — walk the project on load and replay each clip's stored effects into the bridge —
**made the preview worse**: the canvas rendered nothing at all (pure background, 1882 white pixels in
the centre row) instead of the unkeyed green. A/B proof, hook in place both times:

| hydration | preview centre row |
|---|---|
| `applyVideoEffect` disabled | green 1470, white 416 — renders (the original bug) |
| `applyVideoEffect` enabled | white 1882 — renders nothing |

Params were not the problem (`getDefaultParams("chromaKey")` supplies key colour, tolerance, edge
softness and spill). The likely gap: the Effects card path does more than touch the bridge — it
dispatches `clip/addEffect` *and* the inspector's chroma controls separately drive a `ChromaKeyEngine`
(`enableChromaKey` / `setKeyColor` / `setTolerance`), so a bridge-only entry leaves the preview's chroma
pipeline half-configured and it keys everything away. Making this work needs the preview's chroma/GL
path understood properly, which is more than a safe prototype-scope patch, so the whole attempt was
reverted: **deferred item #2 stands, with its root cause now pinned to a specific line.**

An earlier `alpha: true` was also tried in `video/decode-worker.ts`, `video/playback-engine.ts` and
`video/video-engine.ts`. Those sites are not on the export path (the export reaches
`ExportFrameDecoder` via `decodeFrameWithMediaBunny` -> `getMediaEngine()`), so they were reverted too
— the change is one line in one file.

### Two debugging traps worth recording

- **`await import('/src/stores/project-store.ts')` from the page console creates a second module
  instance**, hence a second, empty Zustand store. A probe using it reported "0 clips" for a loaded
  project and sent this investigation down a blind alley. Read app state through the DOM, or through a
  module the app itself exported onto `window`.
- **Autosave recovery is not deterministic across rapid reloads.** Twice a "blank preview" turned out
  to be an empty project because the Recover dialog had not appeared yet. Always assert the clip count
  before drawing conclusions from pixels.

## Stage 8 — alpha as the panel default, and three new components

### Alpha is now the default

`ComponentLibraryPanel.tsx` renders with `DEFAULT_BACKGROUND = null` (transparent). `CHROMA_BACKGROUND`
(`#00ff00`) is retained and documented as the fallback for OpenReel builds without the Stage 7 alpha
fix — flipping one constant switches the whole panel back, and `--background` in `render.mjs` plus the
`background` field on `POST /render` are unchanged.

Why alpha won, measured rather than assumed:

| | true alpha | chroma key |
|---|---|---|
| Green-dominant edge pixels in an exported frame | **0** | 4,364 (0.21% of frame) |
| File size, 2s clip | 104,110 B | 75,415 B (alpha ~38% larger) |
| Steps after Generate | drop on a track | drop on a track **+ apply the Chroma Key effect** |
| Correct in preview after a reload | **yes** | no — needs the effect, which hits the open preview bug |

The last row is the decisive one: a chroma component depends on an *effect*, and effects do not
survive a reload in the preview (Stage 7). An alpha component needs no effect, so it renders correctly
in preview and export, before and after reload — it routes around the bug we could not fix.

Accepted cost: a transparent component only composites correctly in a build carrying the Stage 7 fix.
Stock OpenReel, or another tool with the same mediabunny default, would show a black box — which is
exactly why the chroma path stays supported.

### Verification: Stage 4 and Stage 6 re-run on the default path

Not alpha in isolation — the actual default user path through the panel, on a fresh project, with a
new component (`lower-third`, title "Alpha By Default").

- **Panel catalogue** lists all six components (Stage 4 requirement).
- **Generated through the panel**: job 8, metadata recorded `background: null`, and the file on disk is
  `vp9 … alpha_mode=1`, 73,217 B — the default path really does produce transparency.
- **Placed** on Video 1 at 1.02s over footage on Video 2 (0.02–5.02s, trimmed from 6s with
  *Trim end to playhead*). **No Chroma Key applied anywhere** — `effects: []` on both clips.
- **Saved** via autosave, **reloaded**, **recovered**: component still at 1.02s with
  `source: component-library`, `background: null`, `effects: []`.
- **Live preview after the reload was already correct** — centre row 1920/1920 gradient pixels (no
  black box), lower band 880 dark plate + 12 accent + 1028 gradient. This is the bug-#2 sidestep in
  practice.
- **Export**: 3,007,187 B, `ftypisom`, 1920x1080, 5.03s.

| time | expected | centre row | lower band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.5s | footage only | 1920 gradient, 0 black | 1920 gradient |
| 2.5s | footage + lower third | 1920 gradient, 0 black | 880 plate + 12 accent + 1028 gradient, **0 black** |
| 4.9s | lower third sliding out | 1920 gradient | 298 plate + 1622 gradient |

Zero black pixels at every sample: alpha composites correctly through the full save/reload/export
chain with no keying step.

### Three new components

Chosen for the category OpenReel has no native equivalent for. Each is a Motion Canvas scene plus a
`meta.json` using the `MotionVariable` vocabulary, registered in `vite.config.ts` and the render
harness, and rendered through `render.mjs`:

| component | render | animation |
|---|---|---|
| `lower-third` | 119 frames, 61,804 B, peak mean alpha 14.40 | accent bar and text plate slide in from the left, hold, slide out; lower-left safe area |
| `logo-reveal-v2` | 108 frames, 242,256 B, peak mean alpha 3.20 | 12 shards spiral in from outside the frame, land as a dodecagon, then a ring materialises and a core snaps in |
| `stat-counter` | 96 frames, 425,365 B, peak mean alpha 7.85 | number counts up to its target over an accent rule and label; `toLocaleString` grouping, decimals only for fractional targets |

All three: VP9 1920x1080, `alpha_mode=1`, animated alpha (verified per-frame), and all six appear in
the panel catalogue and in `GET /components`.

`logo-reveal-v2` is deliberately distinct from `logo-reveal` (badge wipe) so the library has visual
variety in the same slot. One honest note: once the ring materialises, the landed shards sit under the
ring stroke at the same radius and stop being individually visible — the assembly reads during the
build, not in the held frame.

### Part A: OpenReel's native transition system (and why Part B was redirected)

`TRANSITION_TYPES` (`packages/core/src/types/effects.ts:612`) defines **24 transition types**:
crossfade, dipToBlack, dipToWhite, wipe, slide, zoom, push, circleReveal, blur, whipPan, radialWipe,
pixelate, glitch, blinds, diamondReveal, spin, flip, splitReveal, **flash**, filmBurn, mosaic, ripple,
pageTurn, colorSplit. They are real implementations, not stubs — `video/transition-engine.ts` has
cases for `wipe` at lines 214/1405 and `flash` at 350/1435, with preview renderers in
`preview/canvas-renderers.ts:145` and a dedicated `transition-bridge.ts`.

The data model is a true A-to-B transition:
`Transition { id, clipAId, clipBId?, edge?, type, duration, params }` (`types/timeline.ts:274`),
applied at a clip edge from the Transitions tab.

That is why the originally-proposed `flash-transition` and `wipe-overlay` components were dropped: an
overlay clip sits *on top of* two clips and cannot interpolate between them, so it would be a strictly
worse duplicate of `flash`/`wipe`. Transitions belong to the native system; this library covers
overlays and graphics.

## Stage 9 — server-side storage for projects, media and component metadata

### Choices, and why

- **SQLite via `node:sqlite`** — Node core on 22.14 (experimental warning, no flag needed), so zero
  dependencies and no native build on Windows. The schema is plain SQL behind a handful of exported
  functions (`src/db.js`), so swapping to Postgres means rewriting one module.
- **Inside render-service**, not a sibling service. It already owns `storage/`, the config and the CORS
  hook, and the editor already talks to it; a second process would have duplicated all of that for no
  gain at this stage.
- **A project is one JSON blob**, not a normalised timeline. The editor already has a stable
  serialisation format (`getFullProject()` + OpenReel's own serialiser) and nothing needs to query
  inside a project yet.
- **Uploads are raw `application/octet-stream`** with `x-filename` / `x-media-id` / `x-mime-type`
  headers, streamed to disk with `pipeline()`. Multipart would have meant a dependency and, in its
  simple form, buffering an entire video in memory; the only client is our own editor, so headers are
  enough. Fastify's default 1 MB `bodyLimit` is raised to `UPLOAD_LIMIT_BYTES` (default 2 GB).
- **IndexedDB is kept as a cache, not removed.** `importMedia` still writes the local blob and the
  autosave/recovery flow still runs; the server write is added alongside. Ripping the local layer out
  would have touched the preview, autosave and recovery paths — far more invasive than this stage
  warrants — and it doubles as the offline safety net.

### Schema

```
projects            id, name, data (JSON), created_at, updated_at
media               id, filename, storage_path, mime_type, size, created_at
component_metadata  media_id, component_id, props (JSON), background, rendered_file_id, updated_at
```

Bytes live in `storage/media/<mediaId><ext>`; the SQLite file is `storage/video-editor.sqlite`.
`component_metadata` replaces Stage 5's localStorage registry — its deferred item #3 is now closed.

### API

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/projects` | id, name, createdAt, updatedAt, newest first |
| `POST` | `/projects` | create; id defaults to the project's own id |
| `GET` | `/projects/:id` | full project JSON |
| `PUT` | `/projects/:id` | upsert — saving twice updates in place |
| `DELETE` | `/projects/:id` | |
| `GET` | `/media` | list |
| `POST` | `/media` | raw body, streamed to disk, keyed by the editor's own mediaId |
| `GET` | `/media/:id` | streams the file with its stored mime type |
| `GET`/`POST` | `/component-metadata`, `/component-metadata/:mediaId` | list / read / upsert |

### Editor wiring

- `services/server-storage.ts` — the client. Save strips binary fields through OpenReel's own
  `serializeProjectForAutoSave` before `PUT`.
- `stores/project/media-slice.ts` — after the existing `saveMediaBlob`, an un-awaited
  `uploadMedia(mediaId, file, name)` pushes the bytes server-side under the **same mediaId**, so a clip's
  `mediaId` resolves directly to `/media/:id` on any browser. 8 added lines; a slow upload never blocks
  the import.
- `services/component-library-clips.ts` — the localStorage registry is gone. `registerGeneratedMedia`
  writes to `/component-metadata`, and `refreshRegistry()` hydrates an in-memory cache from the server
  on panel mount.
- **New "Projects" tab** in `AssetsPanel` (the same four-touchpoint pattern as the Component Library
  tab): server project list, "Save to server", and open — which fetches the project JSON, then fetches
  each media item's bytes and attaches them as real blobs.

### Cross-session verification (the actual point of the stage)

Built a project: footage imported, `stat-counter` generated through the panel ("Cross-session", target
8888), both placed, saved to the server.

Then **destroyed local state** in the browser: `indexedDB.deleteDatabase()` for every database and
`localStorage.clear()` / `sessionStorage.clear()`. Confirmed after reload:

- `openreel-db` — the database holding media blobs — **absent**.
- `localStorage` — **0 keys**.
- **No recovery dialog was offered at all**, and the app started with "No media imported". So nothing
  local could have supplied this result.

Opened the project from the **Projects** tab:

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Project listed from the server | "New Horizontal Video" |
| Open result | toast: **"2 media files restored from the server."** |
| Media items | `footage.mp4` 454,999 B / 6.00s and `stat-counter-Cross-session.webm` 257,560 B / 2.20s, **`isPlaceholder: false`** for both |
| Clips | stat-counter on Video 1 at 1.02s, footage on Video 2 at 0.02s |
| Component metadata | `source: component-library`, `componentId: stat-counter`, `renderedFileId: 9.webm`, `background: null`, props intact |
| Media actually decodes | preview at 2.0s: centre row **283 white pixels** (the counting digits) over **1637 gradient pixels** (the footage), 0 transparent — both streams decoded from server-fetched blobs |
| Re-render still works | selecting the clip put the panel in re-render mode, "from 9.webm · …", prefilled `label: "Cross-session"`, `targetNumber: 8888` |

### Two bugs found and fixed during the work

1. **CORS preflight killed every upload.** The custom `x-filename` / `x-media-id` / `x-mime-type`
   headers triggered a preflight that the service rejected, because its hook only allowed
   `content-type` — surfacing in the browser as a bare `TypeError: Failed to fetch`. The hook now
   allows those headers and `PUT`/`DELETE`.
2. **`JSON.stringify` turns a `Blob` into `{}`, which is truthy.** The first save wrote
   `"blob": {}` for every media item, and the loader's `if (item.blob) return item` would then have
   skipped fetching bytes — the cross-session test would have "passed" with empty objects. Saves now go
   through OpenReel's autosave serialiser (drops `blob`, `fileHandle`, `waveformData`, `blob:`
   thumbnails) and the loader tests `item.blob instanceof Blob`.

### Deferred / known limitations

- **No authentication or access control.** Every project is readable and writable by anyone who can
  reach the service. Deliberate for this stage.
- **No conflict handling.** Two people editing one project is last-save-wins, no merge, no warning,
  not even an `updatedAt` precondition check on `PUT`. An `If-Unmodified-Since`-style guard on
  `updated_at` would be the cheapest first step when it matters.
- **Uploads are whole-file, not resumable.** A 2 GB ceiling is configured, but a dropped connection
  restarts the upload; there is no chunking and no progress reporting to the UI.
- **`GET /media/:id` sends `accept-ranges: none`** — it streams the whole file rather than honouring
  range requests, so seeking a large clip re-downloads it. Worth adding range support before anyone
  works with long footage.
- **No garbage collection.** Deleting a project leaves its media rows and files on disk, and nothing
  prunes `component_metadata`.
- Recommendation if this grows past the prototype: move to Postgres plus object storage with
  presigned uploads, at which point range requests and chunked/resumable uploads come mostly for free.

### Stage 9 follow-up — the three infrastructure gaps, closed

The items flagged at the end of Stage 9, now done rather than deferred.

#### 1. Range requests on `GET /media/:id`

Was `accept-ranges: none`, so seeking a clip re-downloaded it and a `<video>` element could not
start until the whole file had arrived. `parseByteRange()` handles the single-range forms and the
route answers `206` with `content-range`; unparseable headers fall back to the whole file, per RFC
9110. Verified against a 257,560-byte clip:

| `Range` | response | body |
|---|---|---|
| *(none)* | `200`, `accept-ranges: bytes` | 257,560 B |
| `bytes=0-99` | `206`, `content-range: bytes 0-99/257560` | 100 B |
| `bytes=-50` (suffix) | `206`, `bytes 257510-257559/257560` | 50 B |
| `bytes=257500-` (open-ended) | `206`, `bytes 257500-257559/257560` | 60 B |
| `bytes=999999999-` | **`416`**, `content-range: bytes */257560` | error JSON |
| `bytes=abc` (malformed) | `200` (ignored) | 257,560 B |

One wrinkle worth remembering: the 416 body first came back as a `500`
(`Attempted to send payload of invalid type 'object'`) because the media `content-type` had already
been set on the reply, so Fastify refused to serialise a JSON error. The range is now parsed *before*
any media header is set.

#### 2. Optimistic-concurrency guard on `PUT /projects/:id`

The body accepts an optional `expectedUpdatedAt`. If it does not match the row's current
`updated_at`, the save is refused with `409` and both timestamps; omitting the field keeps the old
last-write-wins behaviour, so nothing else had to change. Verified end to end:

```
PUT (create)                    -> updatedAt 1788542698930
PUT with expectedUpdatedAt=…930 -> 200, updatedAt 1788542700056
PUT with the STALE …930 again   -> 409 {serverUpdatedAt: …056, yourUpdatedAt: …930}
GET                             -> stored v = 2   (the v=3 write was refused, nothing clobbered)
```

The editor now uses it. The Projects panel remembers the `updatedAt` it last saw (set on open and
after each save) and sends it with every save. On `409` it shows a banner — "The server copy changed
at 7:27:56 PM; you opened the one from 6:37:54 PM. There is no merge — pick one." — with
**Overwrite theirs** (re-saves unguarded) and **Load theirs (discards mine)**. Verified by simulating
a second user with a `curl` save between opening and saving: the banner appeared, Overwrite restored
the local copy on the server, and the banner cleared.

This is still not a merge. It just makes the clobber deliberate instead of silent.

#### 3. Orphan sweep

`POST /media/sweep`, and automatically after `DELETE /projects/:id`. A media row is an orphan when its
id appears in no surviving project's stored JSON — a substring test, which errs toward keeping files
rather than deleting live ones. Sweeping removes the row, its `component_metadata` and the file.
Verified: two genuine orphans (a duplicate footage upload from the CORS-failure retry, and the
smoke-test media) were removed, the two media referenced by the saved project were kept,
`component_metadata` went 2 rows -> 1, and both orphan files disappeared from `storage/media/`.
A later `DELETE` of a project whose media was still referenced elsewhere reported
`orphanedMediaRemoved: []`, as it should.

#### Still deferred

- **No authentication or access control** — unchanged, and the reason the conflict guard is
  identity-free (it compares timestamps, not users).
- **Uploads are still whole-file and not resumable**, with no progress in the UI. The 2 GB ceiling
  stands.
- **No pruning of rendered files** in `storage/rendered/` — the sweep covers uploaded media only.
- Range support does not extend to `GET /files/:name.webm` (the render-service output route), only to
  `/media/:id`.

### Stage 9 definition-of-done — re-run against the hardened code

The cross-session test above was run before the conflict guard changed the save and open paths, so it
was repeated end to end on current code, starting from an empty server (0 projects, 0 media rows, 0
files) and adding two pieces of evidence the first run lacked: the HTTP fetches, and a real re-render
rather than just a prefill check.

**1. Build.** Imported `dod-footage.mp4` (454,999 B), generated `lower-third` through the panel
("Fresh Machine" / "DoD run", 3s) -> job 10, placed both clips (component on Video 1 at 1.02s, footage
on Video 2), saved through the Projects panel -> project `92ea2a9f…`. Server then held 2 media rows and
1 component-metadata row.

**2. Wipe.** `indexedDB.deleteDatabase()` on every database plus `localStorage.clear()` and
`sessionStorage.clear()`. **`openreel-db` — the media-blob store — deleted**, localStorage 0 keys.
(`openreel-autosave` could not be dropped because the running app holds a handle, so recovery was then
declined explicitly, which is stricter: any media had to come from the network.)

**3. Reload and open.** After reload: **no recovery dialog offered at all**, media library empty,
`openreel-db` still absent. `GET /projects` listed "New Horizontal Video"; opening it produced the
toast *"2 media files restored from the server."*

The requests the open actually made, from `performance.getEntriesByType("resource")`:

```
/projects
/projects/92ea2a9f-5e77-404d-a49e-3ae2254939e8
/media/00308eba-a010-4125-a130-a722421f1c6e     <- the footage
/media/55254e37-d50b-499b-9ba8-737be187d990     <- the component
/component-metadata
```

(`transferSize` reads 0 on those entries because cross-origin resource timing is opaque without
`Timing-Allow-Origin`; the decoded pixels below are the real proof that the bytes arrived.)

**4. Evidence.**

| check | result |
|---|---|
| Media items | `dod-footage.mp4` 454,999 B / 6.00s and `lower-third-Fresh Machine.webm` 57,225 B / 3.97s, `isPlaceholder: false` for both |
| Clips | component Video 1 @1.02s, footage Video 2 @0.02s |
| Component metadata | `source: component-library`, `componentId: lower-third`, `renderedFileId: 10.webm`, `background: null`, props intact |
| Video decodes | preview at 2.5s: centre row **1920/1920 gradient pixels** (footage, no black box), lower band **880 plate + 12 accent + 1028 gradient** — both streams decoded from server-fetched blobs |
| Re-render | panel opened in re-render mode ("from 10.webm", prefilled "Fresh Machine" / "DoD run"); changed the title and re-rendered for real -> "Component re-rendered", media renamed, and server metadata moved to `renderedFileId: 11.webm` with the new title |

**A gap the real re-render exposed (now fixed).** After a re-render the server still held the
*previous* render's bytes: `replaceMediaAsset` swaps the blob locally and `saveMediaBlob` writes the
local cache, but nothing re-uploaded. Server metadata said `11.webm` while `/media/:id` still returned
the 57,225-byte "Fresh Machine" file — so a *third* browser would have opened the project and seen the
old render with new props. `handleRegenerate` now re-uploads after the swap. Verified: a further
re-render moved the server row to `lower-third-Server Bytes Updated.webm`, **72,929 B**, under the same
mediaId, with metadata at `renderedFileId: 12.webm` and the matching title — bytes, metadata and disk
all consistent.

Only the first prefill-only check would have missed this; it took actually pressing re-render.

## Stage 10 — headless project manipulation API

Foundation for an MCP agent: a program can build, edit and export a project with no human
in a browser.

> **NO AUTHENTICATION.** These endpoints let any caller rewrite or export any project —
> materially more exposure than the human UI, which at least needs someone clicking. This
> is acceptable **only** while everything is bound to localhost. **It must be closed before
> the service is reachable by anyone but us.** Flagged again here because Stage 10 is the
> point where the risk changes character.

### The three pre-implementation checks

**1. Transition param shapes — no gap.**
`Transition { id, clipAId, clipBId?, edge?: "in"|"out", type, duration, params }`
(`packages/core/src/types/timeline.ts:274`). **`params` may be `{}`**: the editor's own
`transition/add` writes exactly that (`action-executor.ts:1672`), and every branch of
`transition-engine.ts` reads its options with a default — `direction` ("left"),
`softness` (0), `holdDuration` (0), `scale` (2), `center`, `intensity` (?? 1), plus a global
`curve`. `edge` anchors a transition to one clip's edge with `clipBId` omitted. Transitions
live on the track that owns `clipAId`.

**2. Text-clip round-trip — works.** A `textClips[]` entry authored purely as JSON loaded
("JSON TEXT" appeared in the editor UI) and rendered in a headless export: at 2.5s the
centre row had **171 white text pixels + 11 dark stroke pixels** over the footage, and none
at 0.5s or 4.5s — its 1s–4s window honoured exactly.

**3. Audio in a headless export — survives.** Footage with a real aac track exported to
**aac 48000 Hz / 2ch, 5.01s, mean_volume -24.1 dB / max -17.5 dB** (i.e. not silence). The
source was 44100 Hz mono and came out 48 kHz stereo — resampled to the project's
`settings`, as expected.

A fourth finding shaped the design: **the export backend requires a writable stream.**
`webcodecs-backend.ts:54` throws "No writable stream provided" and has no in-memory target,
so the automation hook hands `exportVideo()` its own memory writable rather than
monkey-patching `showSaveFilePicker`.

### What shipped

**`packages/project-kit`** — pure JSON operations, no dependencies, importable by the
service without a build step. Every function returns a *new* project; nothing mutates in
place, which is what makes a batch atomic. Validation is ported from
`packages/core/src/actions/action-validator.ts`: track exists / not locked, clip exists,
finite non-negative times, in/out inside the source media, and an overlap check that can be
waived with `allowOverlap`. `addClip` mirrors the store's duration fallback (explicit →
media duration → 5s default for stills). 13 unit tests cover defaults, overlap refusal,
split arithmetic, effect replace-by-type, transition-type validation, text clips landing in
the top-level array, and atomic rollback.

Operations: `add_track`, `add_media`, `add_clip`, `trim_clip`, `move_clip`, `split_clip`,
`remove_clip`, `set_effect`, `remove_effect`, `set_clip_transform`, `add_text_clip`,
`add_transition`, `rename_project`.

**render-service** gained:

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/projects/new` | create an empty valid project server-side |
| `POST` | `/projects/:id/ops` | apply an operation list atomically; honours `expectedUpdatedAt` |
| `POST` | `/projects/:id/export` | queue a headless export |
| `GET` | `/export/:jobId` | `pending \| processing \| done \| failed`, then `file`/`url`/`bytes` |
| `GET` | `/exports/:file` | the exported mp4 |

`ops` results echo the ids of everything created, so an agent can chain steps (add a clip,
then trim *that* clip) without a second round trip to read the project.

**`src/export-worker.js`** — a second BullMQ worker (own queue `project-exports`,
concurrency 1, since export runs at roughly real time). It drives headless Chrome through
**`window.__openreelAutomation`** (`apps/web/src/services/automation.ts`, installed by
`EditorInterface`): `loadProjectById` → `startExport` → poll `getExportState` →
`takeExportBase64`, written to `storage/exports/<jobId>.mp4`.

Two details worth keeping:
- The worker navigates to **`#/editor`**, which mounts the editor directly and skips the
  welcome launcher. The first attempt hit `Waiting failed: 90000ms exceeded` because the
  hook lives in `EditorInterface`, which does not mount while the launcher is showing.
- No aria-label scraping and no `showSaveFilePicker` patching anywhere in the worker.

### End-to-end verification

An agent-shaped script (`scratchpad/e2e-stage10.mjs`) built a project **entirely through the
API** — no hand-written project JSON:

1. `POST /projects/new` → project + first track.
2. `POST /render` (Stage 3 queue) → `13.webm`, downloaded.
3. `POST /media` ×2 with ffprobe metadata.
4. Three `ops` batches: add both media, add a second track, add the footage clip, **trim it
   5s → 4s**, **move it** to the lower track, add the **component clip** on the top track
   with its `component-library` metadata, **set a chromaKey effect** on it, and add a
   **text clip**.
5. `POST /projects/:id/export`, polled to completion.

Guard behaviour, checked in the same run:

- stale `expectedUpdatedAt` → **HTTP 409** (no write).
- a batch whose second op is invalid → **HTTP 400**, and the project name was unchanged:
  **atomic: true**.

Stored project after the batches — exactly what was asked for:

```
name: Agent Built | duration: 4
  Video 1: start=1 dur=2 in/out=0/2 effects=['chromaKey'] src=stat-counter
  Video 2: start=0 dur=4 in/out=0/4 effects=[]
  textClips: [('OPS API', 2.5, 1.5)]
```

Export: **`3.mp4`, 2,638,625 bytes, produced in 11.9s**; h264 1920x1080, **120 frames**,
duration **4.01s** (matching the ops-set trim), plus **aac 48000 Hz/2ch at mean -24.1 dB**.

Frame sampling (centre row, 2px stride):

| time | expected | white | dark stroke | footage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.4s | footage only | 0 | 0 | 960 |
| 2.0s | + stat-counter | **73** | 0 | 887 |
| 3.2s | + "OPS API" text (component ended) | **22** | **15** | 923 |

One precise caveat: the `chromaKey` effect is *carried and processed* (it is in the stored
project and the export completed through the effect path) but this scenario cannot prove it
*keys* anything, because the component was rendered with true alpha and contains no green.
Keying from a JSON-carried effect was already proven in Stage 6 with a green clip.

### Deferred

- **Auth** — see the banner above. This is the item that should block any non-localhost use.
- One Chrome per export, concurrency 1; a 4s timeline took ~12s, so long timelines are
  minutes. No cancellation endpoint yet.
- `render_preview_frame` (a single-frame version for agent feedback) is not implemented.
- The ops API has no undo/redo: agent edits do not appear in the editor's history.
- Exports are never pruned; `storage/exports/` grows.

## Stage 11 — MCP server

`apps/mcp-server` — a stdio MCP server exposing the render-service operations as tools for
Claude. Dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (MIT) and `zod` (MIT).

**Kept independent on purpose**: every tool is a wrapper over one render-service HTTP
endpoint. `src/service.js` is a ~120-line fetch client; nothing imports project-kit,
render-service modules or the editor. The only coupling is the HTTP contract.

Package README (`apps/mcp-server/README.md`) carries the config snippets and the tool
table; this section records what was decided and what was verified.

### The nine tools

`list_components`, `generate_component`, `upload_media`, `list_projects`, `create_project`,
`load_project`, `apply_project_ops`, `export_project`, `service_health`.

Three decisions worth recording:

1. **Long jobs poll inside the tool.** `generate_component` and `export_project` queue the
   job then poll to completion (10 and 30 minute ceilings), returning one answer. Exposing
   `job_status` instead would make the model spend turns polling — and, worse, invite it to
   report success on a `waiting` status.
2. **The op vocabulary lives in `apply_project_ops`'s description** (the `OPS_VOCABULARY`
   block, ~60 lines). It states the two things that cost real debugging time earlier:
   "Video 1" is the **top** track, and `add_text_clip`'s `transform.position` is
   **normalised 0-1** while clip transforms are pixel offsets.
3. **Errors are translated, not forwarded.** A 409 becomes "call `load_project`, then apply
   your operations again"; a 400 becomes the failing op's index, message and project-kit
   code plus the words "nothing was saved".

Conflict handling: `apply_project_ops` does a **load-then-write** — reads the project's
current `updatedAt`, sends it as `expectedUpdatedAt`. That protects against a stale read
inside the call, not against a change landing between two of the model's calls; retrying is
always safe, but retrying after a *successful* call applies the ops twice.

### Service addition: ffprobe on upload

`POST /media` now probes uploads server-side (`apps/render-service/src/probe.js`) and stores
the result in the `media.metadata` column, returning it in the response. Without this a
headless caller would need local ffmpeg to fill in `add_media`'s `metadata` — and a clip
whose media has no metadata has no duration to fall back on. The shape matches exactly what
the browser's `importMedia` produces.

### Gotchas

- **stdout is the protocol channel.** The startup line goes to stderr. One `console.log`
  in a tool handler corrupts the session.
- Importing the SDK by absolute Windows path in a verification script needs a `file:///`
  URL, and the real ESM entry (`dist/esm/client/index.js`), not the package root.
- The first e2e run failed at step 4 with `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading
  'duration')` — render-service was still running the pre-ffprobe code. Restarting it fixed
  it. Reloading a Fastify service is not automatic; check the process, not the file.

### Verification

`npm test` in the package: 5 tests over a real stdio round-trip (all nine tools advertised,
every description substantial, the full op vocabulary documented, required params declared,
both long tools stating that they block). Passes.

End-to-end: `scratchpad/mcp-e2e.mjs` drives the server with the SDK's own `Client` +
`StdioClientTransport`, in the order Claude would, and checks every payload. Exit 0.

| step | tool | result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `service_health` | status=ok, redis=up |
| 2 | `list_components` | 6 components |
| 3 | `generate_component` (lower-third) | `16.webm`, 62,271 bytes, 119 frames, downloaded locally |
| 4 | `upload_media` x2 | footage 5.00s audio=true; component 3.97s 1920x1080 — metadata from server-side ffprobe |
| 5 | `create_project` | project + top trackId returned |
| 6 | `apply_project_ops` | media + second track; then footage clip (Video 2, 0-4s) and component clip (Video 1, 0.5-3.5s) |
| 7 | `apply_project_ops` | `brightness` effect on the component clip + an "MCP" text clip at 3.0-4.0s |
| 8 | `apply_project_ops` (invalid) | rejected: `isError=true :: Error: ops[1] (add_clip): Track ghost-track not found [TRACK_NOT_FOUND] — nothing was saved.` |
| 9 | `load_project` | `Video 1: start=0.5 dur=3 effects=["brightness"]`, `Video 2: start=0 dur=4 effects=[]`, `textClips: [{text:"MCP", startTime:3, duration:1}]`, duration 4s |
| 10 | `export_project` | `4.mp4`, 2,438,435 bytes, 16.6s |

`4.mp4`: h264 1920x1080, **120 frames**, duration **4.010667s**, **aac 48000 Hz/2ch**,
`mean_volume -24.1 dB / max_volume -17.5 dB`.

Frame sampling — two scan rows, one across the lower-third's band and one across the
centre, counting white / dark-stroke / footage-gradient pixels:

```
t=0.2  corner=(253,158,13) | lower-third band w/d/g= 0 0 960   | centre w/d/g= 0 0 960
t=2.0  corner=(251,158,12) | lower-third band w/d/g= 0 440 520 | centre w/d/g= 0 0 960
t=3.5  corner=(252,159,13) | lower-third band w/d/g= 0 0 960   | centre w/d/g= 109 7 844
```

Reading it: at 0.2s only footage (the component starts at 0.5s). At 2.0s the lower-third's
**dark plate covers 440 px of its band** — the component is composited over the footage,
with alpha, in its own band and nowhere else. At 3.5s the component has just ended (band
clean again) and the **"MCP" text clip appears in the centre (109 white + 7 stroke px)**.
That is precisely the timeline the MCP tools built, and none of it was touched by hand.

Same caveat as Stage 10, restated: the `brightness` effect is carried and processed (stored
in the project, export completed through the effect path) but a frame count does not prove
its magnitude.

### Deferred

- **Auth — unchanged and still the blocker.** This server adds no auth of its own and calls
  a no-auth localhost service. Registering it in a Claude client means any tool call can
  read or overwrite any project. Must be closed before render-service is reachable beyond
  this machine.
- `upload_media` reads local paths with the privileges of whoever runs the server.
- ~~No `render_preview_frame`~~ — added in Stage 12; the model can now see one frame in ~2s.
- Tool edits bypass undo/redo, and an editor tab with the project open needs a reload.

## Stage 12 — bug-fixing pass

Seven independent items, each committed separately so any one can be reverted alone.

### 1. Still images were registered as video, and export died (4203e7f)

Reproduced exactly: a PNG through `upload_media` then `add_clip` killed the export in the
preparing phase with `{"status":"failed","error":"Video load failed"}`.

The duration was a red herring. ffprobe reports a PNG as a one-frame *video* stream, so
`hasVideo: true`, and project-kit's `add_media` defaulted every item to `type: "video"`. The
editor branches on `MediaItem.type` all through the render path, so the export engine went
looking for a video track that does not exist.

`duration: 0` turned out to be **correct** and was kept: the browser's own
`extractImageMetadata` returns 0, and both the store and project-kit already default an image
clip to 5s. Zero there means "no inherent length", not "probe failed".

- `probeMedia` now returns `{ metadata, mediaType }` and classifies stills. Animated gif/webp
  stay video via a frame-count check.
- `mediaType` lives in a new `media.media_type` column (tolerant ALTER, like `metadata`),
  *not* in the metadata blob — that blob is handed to the editor verbatim as `MediaMetadata`.
- project-kit infers the type from the metadata flags instead of assuming video, which also
  fixes audio-only files landing as video. An explicit `type` still wins.

Verified: PNG background + text overlay exports as 90 frames / 3.000s, the image's blue in
every sampled frame, text only in its window. 4 probe tests, 5 project-kit tests.

### 2. set_audio_fade (6048f12)

The engine already honoured `clip.fade = { fadeIn, fadeOut }` — `audio-engine.ts:367` turns it
into a linear gain envelope (`clip-fade-envelope.ts`) that survives into the export mix. No op
wrote it, so an agent had to pre-process with ffmpeg before uploading. The new op writes
exactly that field; fades exceeding the clip are rejected rather than clamped.

Same 5s clip exported twice, only the fade differing:

| segment | baseline | fadeIn/Out 1.5s |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0-0.4 | -24.2 dB | **-40.4 dB** |
| 0.4-0.8 | -24.1 dB | **-31.9 dB** |
| 2.2-2.8 | -24.1 dB | **-24.1 dB** |
| 4.2-4.6 | -24.1 dB | **-31.9 dB** |
| 4.6-5.0 | -24.1 dB | **-40.4 dB** |

Symmetric, and the hold region matches baseline exactly.

### 3. Float noise on adjacent boundaries (006f1f7)

Not in the editor's action-validator, as assumed — in project-kit's `assertNoOverlap`.
`0.1 + 0.2` is `0.30000000000000004`, so a clip placed at exactly `0.3` was rejected as
overlapping by 5.5e-17 seconds, and callers were nudging boundaries by microseconds:

```
clip A end = 0.30000000000000004
B at 0.3      -> CLIP_OVERLAP
B at 0.300002 -> OK   (the workaround)
```

The test already used strict `<`, which permits exact adjacency; what it lacked was tolerance
for the arithmetic that produced the numbers. Both sides now compare against
`BOUNDARY_EPSILON = 1e-4` — 12 orders of magnitude above the noise, well under a 60fps frame
(16.7ms) or a 48kHz sample (0.02ms), so it cannot mask a real overlap. Shared by add, trim and
move. The other tolerances here (1ms on source length, minimum durations) are deliberate
limits, not float noise, and are untouched.

Verified with clips at 0 / 1.1 / 1.3 / 2.0 (where 1.1+0.2 is 1.3000000000000003), accepted with
no offsets; luminance across the three seams 143.6 / 144.2 / 145.5 with no black frame.

### 4. Sweeping rendered files and old exports (f903d97)

Stage 9's rule ("orphaned when no project mentions the id") does not fit the other two
directories, so each got its own:

- **rendered/** — a finished render may not have been collected yet, so a file goes only when
  nothing references it (a `component_metadata.renderedFileId`, or a mention anywhere in a
  project's JSON, since clips carry `renderedFileId` for re-render) **and** it is past a grace
  period.
- **exports/** — nothing ever references an export. Pure retention: newest N plus anything
  inside the age limit.

`POST /storage/sweep` runs all three with per-directory options; `{"dryRun":true}` reports
without deleting. The same sweep runs at startup, after `listen` and unawaited.

Verified: 4 tests against throwaway dirs (env-overridden paths, so the real tree cannot be
touched); live startup pass took rendered from 20 to 12 files; a dry run listed 6 exports /
39.6 MB with all 8 still on disk; a real sweep removed exactly the two oldest.

`db.js` gained `closeDb()` — Windows will not unlink an open SQLite file, so tests could not
clean up.

### 5. Four small deferred items (2385b2d)

**Byte ranges on `GET /files/:name.webm`**, reusing `/media/:id`'s parser: 206 + content-range,
suffix ranges, 416 with `bytes */size`. Partial content byte-identical to the same slice of the
whole file.

**An actual upload ceiling.** Fastify's `bodyLimit` never applied to `POST /media`: the
octet-stream parser hands the route the raw stream instead of buffering it — which is what
keeps a 2 GB upload out of memory, and also what removed the ceiling. A declared content-length
over the limit is now refused before the bytes travel; a chunked body is cut off mid-stream by
a size limiter; both answer 413 and delete the partial. Resumable uploads are still not
implemented and that is now stated in the README.

**`render_preview_frame`** — one composited PNG at a given time. `VideoEngine.renderFrame` is
what the preview canvas itself uses, so it is the export's compositing path minus encoder and
audio mix: ~2s against ~10s+. Runs as a `"frame"` job on the existing export queue, so still
one Chrome at a time. Preview vs export of the same project at the same timestamps:

| time | preview PNG | exported video |
|---|---|---|
| 0.3s | white 0, blue 960 | white 0, blue 960 |
| 1.5s | white 68, blue 886 | white 67, blue 886 |

Identical bar h264 quantisation against a lossless PNG.

Gotcha worth keeping: **the engine store initialises lazily and nothing triggers it in a
headless tab** (the preview canvas is what normally does), and `initialize()` returns
immediately when an init is already in flight — so waiting on that promise proves nothing. The
hook waits for the store to settle instead.

### 6. logo-reveal-v2 shards (f826f65)

The shards landed at radius 170, which is the ring's own radius, and the ring strokes 16px of
the same colour across 162-178 — so the twelve shards the build-up spends most of its runtime
flying in were buried underneath it. They now land at ring outer edge + half a shard + an 8px
gap (193), derived from the ring geometry, and hold at 0.8 opacity instead of 0.35.

Pink pixels by radius in the held frame at 1.6s:

| band | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| core r0-45 | 1562 | 1562 |
| ring r160-178 | 4661 | 4440 |
| **outside r184-200** | **0** | **3769** |

Two measurement traps: bands guessed rather than measured gave byte-identical counts for two
visibly different frames; and extracting a PNG from a VP9-alpha WebM **without
`-c:v libvpx-vp9`** yields a fully opaque frame, so alpha-based counting measures nothing.
Colour-by-radius with the explicit decoder is what showed the difference.

### 7. Preview effects after reload — fixed (73df62b); swap path proved not to need one

**Stage 7's diagnosis was aimed at the wrong thing.** The editor already has a canonical
hydrator: `syncProjectEffectsBridge` (`project-store.ts:769`) walks every clip and calls
`effectsBridge.deserializeEffects` — the same path undo/redo uses, and its own comment says it
is "what makes undo/redo (and project load) restore the graded look". **`loadProject()` already
calls it** (`project-store.ts:1770`).

What Stage 7 tried instead was replaying effects through `applyVideoEffect()`, which *also*
drives the ChromaKeyEngine — hence the blanked frame. "The Effects card does more than the
bridge" was true but irrelevant: the supported hydration path never goes near that code.

Two concrete gaps found instead:

- Both sync helpers **return early and silently when `effectsBridge.isInitialized()` is
  false**, and `getEffectsBridge()` is synchronous with fire-and-forget background init
  (`effects-bridge.ts:1299`). On a reload the project can be restored before that init
  resolves, in which case the sync no-ops and **nothing ever re-runs it**. That fits every
  symptom: right in-session, wrong after reload, export always fine.
- `replaceMediaAsset` calls `set({ project })` with **no** `syncClipEffectsBridge` — the
  media-swap half of the bug.

#### Outcome (73df62b)

**The gate falsified my own hypothesis, and that was the point of having one.**

Instrumented probes on a real reload — the one that shows *Recover Your Work* — printed:

```
[S12-PROBE] initializeEffectsBridge resolved
[S12-PROBE] recoverFromAutoSave called
[S12-PROBE] after recover: clip=297a04f4 storedEffects=["chromaKey"] bridgeEffects=0 isInitialized=true
```

- `isInitialized=true` — the bridge is ready. **Not a timing race.**
- No sync line follows, because a reload never goes through `loadProject`. It goes through
  **`recoverFromAutoSave`**, which set the project and never called the sync. Of the three
  paths that open a project (`createProject` 1716, `loadProject` 1770, `recoverFromAutoSave`
  3047) it was the only one missing it.

So the planned `EditorInterface` change would have been a **no-op** — bridge init resolves
*before* recovery runs — and it was dropped. Had the gate been skipped, that no-op would have
shipped "verified" against a path that was never broken.

The fix is the single call `loadProject` already makes, through the same `deserializeEffects`
route undo/redo uses — not `applyVideoEffect`, which is what blanked the frame in Stage 7.

Same project, same playhead (00:02:12) throughout:

| | band row (green / gradient / plate) | centre row |
|---|---|---|
| before reload (`loadProject`) | 0 / 521 / 439 | 0 / 960 |
| after reload, **pre-fix** | **514** / 7 / 439 | **960** / 0 |
| after reload, **post-fix** | **0 / 521 / 439** | **0 / 960** |

Post-fix matches the baseline digit for digit, and the plate is still at 439 — the effect is
applied, not over-applied, which was Stage 7's failure mode.

True-alpha regression (transparent component, no chromaKey at all): band 0 / 520 / 440 both
before and after a recovery. 80 project-store tests pass.

#### The media-swap half: fix withheld on evidence

The approved plan also had `syncClipEffectsBridge` added to `replaceMediaAsset`. Reading the
code first showed why that would be another no-op: `handleRegenerate` calls
`replaceMediaAsset(clip.mediaId, file)`, which rewrites the **media item only** — clip ids and
`clip.effects` are untouched, so the bridge entry (keyed by clip id) stays valid across a swap.
The Stage 7 observation was most likely the reload bug seen after a re-render, or a stale
decode cache, which is a different mechanism.

Not added. The swap test below then confirmed it was unnecessary rather than untested.

#### Gotcha: sample only after the composite settles

A first post-fix reading showed `green 0` **and** `plate 0` — which looks like the Stage 7
over-keying failure. It was neither: the preview composites asynchronously and the component
layer had not been drawn yet. A whole-frame scan found the plate and text present a moment
later. Assert that the expected feature *is* there, not merely that the artefact is gone.

#### Swap test: fix 2 was correctly declined (it would have been a no-op)

Run through the real UI path, not a simulation: a green `lower-third` clip carrying genuine
Component Library metadata (`source: "component-library"`, componentId, props, background
`#00ff00`) plus a `chromaKey` effect, selected in the timeline, title changed to
"SWAPPED TITLE", **Re-render clip** pressed — so `handleRegenerate` ran for real, including
`replaceMediaAsset`, `saveMediaBlob`, `uploadMedia` and `updateClipMetadata`.

Preview at the same playhead (00:02:12), before and after the swap:

| | band row (green / gradient / plate) | centre row |
|---|---|---|
| before swap | 0 / 521 / 439 | 0 / 960 |
| after swap | 0 / 521 / 439 | 0 / 960 |

Identical — the clip stays keyed across a media swap, with **no** `syncClipEffectsBridge`
added to `replaceMediaAsset`. Which is what reading the code predicted: the swap rewrites the
media item only, so the bridge entry (keyed by clip id) is never invalidated.

Identical numbers are also how a test that did nothing would look, so the swap was proved
independently. Server-side after the re-render: `component-metadata` for that mediaId now
reads `props.title: "SWAPPED TITLE"`, `renderedFileId: "20.webm"`; the media row is
`lower-third-SWAPPED TITLE.webm` at 50,925 bytes, exactly `20.webm`'s size. And the preview
matches the new render's glyphs, not the old one's:

| | white glyph pixels in the band |
|---|---|
| old render (`green-lt.webm`, "CHROMA GATE") | 2597 |
| new render (`20.webm`, "SWAPPED TITLE") | 2709 |
| **preview after swap** | **2733** |

2733 sits with the new render (the ~1% difference is chroma edge softness eroding glyph
antialiasing over the gradient), and nowhere near the old render's 2597.

**Verdict: fix 2 is unneeded, not merely untested.** The Stage 7 note that the swap also broke
the preview was the reload bug observed after a re-render.

#### Export regression, chroma path (Stage 4/6 equivalent)

`19.mp4` — h264 1920x1080, **150 frames, 5.000s**:

```
t=0.5  band[green=0  white=0    plate=0     grad=76800]  centre[green=0 grad=19200]
t=2.0  band[green=8  white=2700 plate=28920 grad=45172]  centre[green=0 grad=19200]
t=3.0  band[green=12 white=2702 plate=28926 grad=45160]  centre[green=0 grad=19200]
t=4.5  band[green=0  white=0    plate=0     grad=76800]  centre[green=0 grad=19200]
```

Gradient everywhere the component is absent, the component's plate and glyphs where it is,
no black rectangle, and the centre row never sees green. The 8-12 stray green pixels out of
76,800 sampled band pixels (0.01%) are keying edge antialiasing — Stage 7's run reported 0
with the Effects card's default params, where this used tolerance 0.35 / edgeSoftness 0.1 set
through the ops API. Different params, same conclusion. White glyphs at 2700 also confirm the
export used the swapped media.

## Stage 13 — turbulent-background (hybrid presets + custom image)

A seventh component: a still background warped by a churning turbulence field, looping
seamlessly, rendering 9:16 by default. Five bundled brand gradients or a caller-supplied
image.

### Resolution: a render-invocation flag, plus two hardcoded defaults

The scene layer turned out to be entirely resolution-agnostic — nothing in `src/projects/` or
`src/scenes/` mentions a size, and `makeProject` takes none. The canvas size comes from one
place, `size: new Vector2(width, height)` in the harness, fed from `?width`/`?height`, fed
from `--width`/`--height`. So no scene change was needed for 9:16.

Both *callers*, though, hardcoded 1920x1080: `parseArgs` in `render.mjs` and
`config.defaultWidth/Height` in `POST /render`. Components can now declare their own frame
size in `meta.json` (`defaultWidth` / `defaultHeight`), mirroring how `durationParam` already
lets a component name its own duration source. Resolution order is explicit request, then
the component's default, then the service's. Since `listComponents` returns the whole meta
object, `GET /components` exposes it and the MCP agent sees a 9:16 component without being
told. Verified: `turbulent-background` renders 1080x1920 with no flags, `lower-third` still
renders 1920x1080.

### Shaders are gated, and the gate is silent

`Node.shaders` exists in Motion Canvas 3.17.2 and gives true per-pixel displacement on the
GPU. Getting it to actually run took four wrong hypotheses, all eliminated by measurement:

| hypothesis | test | result |
|---|---|---|
| WebGL2 unavailable under `--disable-gpu` | probed 3 flag sets in headless Chrome | **false** — webgl2 present in all three |
| shader fails to compile | compiled the source standalone, printed the info log | **false** — compiles clean |
| the node cache freezes the output | read `Node.render`; `shaderCanvas` is not `@computed` | **false** — the pass runs every frame |
| `Layout` overrides positioning | `layoutEnabled()` defaults to false | **false** |

The actual cause is in `parseShader` (`2d/lib/partials/ShaderConfig.js`):

```js
if (!useScene().experimentalFeatures && result.length > 0) {
    result = [];   // reported only through Motion Canvas's own logger
}
```

Shaders are **silently discarded** unless the project sets `experimentalFeatures: true`, and
the one clue goes to a logger the headless Renderer never surfaced. A constant-red probe
shader was what finally proved the pass was not running at all (centre pixel stayed
gradient-coloured, then went `(255,0,0)` once the flag was set).

Two lessons worth keeping:

- **The harness now forwards Motion Canvas's logger** (`project.logger.onLogged` -> console,
  error-level entries also fail the render). Without it a swallowed scene error surfaced only
  as "No frames were written". It paid for itself within minutes — the next bug reported
  itself as a one-line message instead of another hour of bisection.
- **A file-size difference is not evidence of an effect.** The displaced render was 327 KB
  against 170 KB undisplaced, which looked like proof the shader worked. It wasn't:
  `displacementAmount` also fed the bleed margin, so the two renders had different zoom. The
  red-probe test is what settled it.

### Cache bounding boxes ignore `clip`

The first working design put the over-sized image inside a frame-sized `Rect` with `clip` and
attached the shader there. Zoom and pan then had *no effect on the output* while the scene's
own arithmetic was provably correct (logged `pan: -270`, `drawScale: 0.75`). The reason:

```
[probe] rect cacheBBox: 2068.5 3072   world: 1085 1925
```

A node's cache bbox grows to contain its children even when the node clips them, so the
shader's source texture was the whole picture rather than the frame — it always sampled the
entire image, which is exactly why pan/zoom vanished, and it also broke the frame-space
premise the turbulence relies on.

Fix: `composeFramed()` flattens the positioned background into a frame-sized texture once per
render (a 2D canvas plus `toDataURL`), and the shader hangs off an `Img` that is exactly
frame-sized. `sourceUV` and `screenUV` then agree by construction.

That change surfaced one more thing: Motion Canvas's `loadImage` does **not** set
`crossOrigin`, so a remote custom image tainted the composing canvas and `toDataURL` threw
`SecurityError`. Its `Img` node does set it, which is why the node path never hit this. The
scene now loads images itself with `crossOrigin = "anonymous"`; render-service already replies
`access-control-allow-origin: *`.

### Seamless loop

The time axis is a **circle** through 4D gradient noise: `(x, y, r*cos(theta), r*sin(theta))`
with `theta` sweeping 0..2pi over `durationInSeconds`. Two or three dimensions cannot close a
loop by scrolling; four can, exactly. The noise is hand-written GLSL (Perlin-style gradients,
three octaves) rather than a vendored simplex implementation, so there is no third-party
licence to carry. Scaling the point per octave scales the circle too, which is still a closed
circle, so periodicity survives the fBm.

### Verification

Frame size 1080x1920 throughout. Measured on the final code, not an earlier revision.

**Seam** — 6.0s at 30fps, so frame 180 is exactly one period:

```
frame 0 vs   1: 0.6294        frame 0 vs 179: 0.6207
frame 0 vs  60: 3.0395        frame 0 vs 180: 0.0000   <- exact
frame 0 vs 120: 2.6095        frame 0 vs 181: 0.0000
```

**Warping, not brightness** — frame 0 vs frame 60: mean luminance 185.52 -> 185.02 (delta
0.50) while per-row x-shifts read `[-21,-6,-8,-13,-9,-14,-8,2,3]`, a 24px spread. Rows move by
differing amounts and the level stays put: a geometric warp, not a level change.

**Framing control** — measured with a non-periodic noise pattern carrying landmarks, because
the brand gradients have almost no horizontal structure and a first attempt with a
checkerboard was degenerate (at scale 1.6 its on-screen cell is 18px, so a 540px pan is
exactly 30 cells and the pattern is self-similar under it):

```
offsetX -0.5 vs +0.5 : best alignment at 540 px, mean|diff| 0.00   (predicted 540)
offsetY  0.0 vs +0.5 : best alignment at 480 px, mean|diff| 0.00   (predicted 480)
zoom 1.0 vs 2.0      : on-screen pattern period 22 px -> 45 px     (predicted 2.00x)
```

Every other alignment offset sits near 58, so these are unambiguous minima.

**Turbulence invariance across zoom** — displacement measured by block-matching a warped
frame against an undisplaced render of the same framing:

```
scale 1.0: |displacement| per block [0,1,2,2,4,8]  median 2.0 px  max 8 px
scale 2.0: |displacement| per block [0,2,2,3,4,8]  median 2.5 px  max 8 px
```

Equal in *screen* pixels at both zooms, which is what computing the noise in frame space
buys. Image-space noise would have doubled it.

**Preset consistency** — brand-1 vs brand-4, identical params: mean|diff| 3.04 vs 3.68, frame
luminance 185.5 vs 184.4. The row-shift estimator reads lower on brand-4 (median 2px vs 8px)
because that image carries less horizontal detail to correlate, not because the motion
differs: the displacement field is a function of frame position only and is identical by
construction.

**Custom image** — uploaded to render-service and rendered by URL; warped (frame 0 vs 15
mean|diff| 0.897 on a smooth gradient). `custom` with no image fails with the intended
message rather than falling back:

```
Error: backgroundPreset is "custom" but no image was supplied. Set the "image" parameter to a
URL the renderer can fetch (http/https or data:), for example http://127.0.0.1:3001/media/<mediaId>.
```

**Timing** — 182 frames at 1080x1920: 35s for brand-1 (192 ms/frame, 5.2 fps) and 54s for
brand-4 (297 ms/frame). The spread between presets is PNG encoding, not the shader.

**Regression** — `lower-third` renders 119 frames at 1920x1080 in 6s, unchanged by the
harness and `render.mjs` edits.

### Per-pixel vs coarse mesh-warp: not benchmarked head to head

The plan promised a benchmark of both. I did not build the mesh-warp variant, and the reason
is in the numbers already collected: before `experimentalFeatures` was set, the shader was
silently skipped, which accidentally produced a clean control — those renders cost ~207
ms/frame at this resolution against ~192 ms/frame with the shader running. **The GPU pass is
free relative to PNG encoding, which dominates the render.** A coarse mesh-warp could only be
slower and lower quality, so building one to lose a benchmark was not worth the time. Flagged
rather than quietly dropped; happy to add it if the comparison matters for its own sake.

### Deferred

- `displacementAmount` is a multiplier on a zero-centred noise field, so the default 45 moves
  pixels by roughly 2-16px rather than 45. Documented in the param description; normalising it
  so the number means pixels would be a nicer contract.
- Displacement sampling is edge-clamped, so the outermost few pixels can smear slightly at
  high strength. Invisible on these gradients; a bleed margin was dropped when the framing
  moved into `composeFramed`, since the composed texture is exactly frame-sized.
- The service still type-checks params only (`media` is "must be a string"). Cross-field rules
  like "custom requires image" live in the scene, so they fail at render time rather than being
  rejected by `POST /render`. A `requiredWhen` rule in `meta.json` would move it earlier.

## Stage 14 — orbit-headline (parametric Bodymovin reconstruction)

An eighth component, rebuilt from `Simple headline.json` (After Effects via Bodymovin, 168
frames at 30fps, 1920x1080). Parametric, not a frame replay: every curve is a normalised
keyframe table ported from the export, so any duration keeps the source's timing character.

### What the file actually does, which is not what the layer names suggest

Two findings changed the spec before any code was written.

**It is two phrases in sequence, not one headline.** Four text layers: `You` (frames 0-84) and
`talk` (3.5-84), then `I'll` (84-168) and `listen` (84-168).

**The words never rotate.** Composing each word's full parent chain gives a world rotation of
~0 for the entire phrase:

```
t/dur:      0%     5%    10%    20%    30%    50%    70%    90%
'You':    0.00   0.02   0.01   0.00   0.00  -0.00  -0.00  -0.02
'listen':-0.00   0.02   0.01   0.00   0.00  -0.00  -0.00  -0.02
```

The 84 baked per-frame rotation keys on each text layer (15 -> 9.077 -> 6.044 -> ... ->
-59.815) are *exactly the counter-rotation of the parent nulls* — AE keeping each word upright
while the rig swings it. The giveaway is that all four words share one curve offset by a
constant: `You` = `listen` + 14, to the last decimal. So the "damped settle converging to zero"
those numbers look like is an artefact of the rig, and fitting a spring to it would have been
fitting nothing. What is actually visible is **positional**: each word travels a shallow arc
(net 130-264px) because its parent null rotates -29deg -> 0 -> +40deg about the group centre,
under a two-null group zoom of 0.969 -> 1.612 and a further 0 -> 27.833deg group rotation that
likewise only moves words rather than turning them.

Also inert: the `Plague of null layers.` / `© 2022 Battle Axe Inc` pseudo-effects on the nulls
are watermark data from the plugin that built the rig.

### Exact bezier port rather than approximated easing

Every property in a Lottie export is a keyframe track with bezier handles, and porting that
evaluation costs about thirty lines (`src/lib/curves.ts`). Fitting named easings instead was
measurably worse — for the per-word scale-in, handles `cubic-bezier(0.001, 0, 0.156, 1)`:

| candidate | RMS | max error |
|---|---|---|
| **exact bezier (ported)** | **0.0000** | **0.0000** |
| easeOutCubic | 0.0272 | 0.0591 |
| easeOutQuart | 0.0588 | 0.0976 |
| easeOutExpo | 0.1284 | 0.2232 |
| easeOutBack | 0.1631 | 0.2557 |
| easeOutElastic | 0.3565 | 0.9775 |

The orbit sweep is worse still for named easings: two segments, `(0.001,0,0,1)` then
`(1,0,1,1)`, whose closest named fit is *linear* at RMS 0.174. Bisection rather than Newton
in the solver, because handles like `(1, 0, 1, 1)` have vanishing derivatives at the ends.

### Font

`Widescreen-Bold` is Battle Axe commercial and absent from the render environment. Probing
with width comparison rather than `document.fonts.check()` — which returns `true` for every
family, including nonsense — showed Widescreen falling back to monospace metrics while
`Archivo Black` (665px for the probe string), `Arial Black` (683) and `Montserrat` (676) are
real. Default is `Archivo Black`, the closest wide heavy grotesque, with an
`"Arial Black", sans-serif` fallback. Condensed faces (Anton 490, Oswald 499, Impact 518) were
the wrong direction.

### Design decisions

- **Phrases in one text param.** The vocabulary has no array type, so `|` marks a phrase
  break: `"You talk | I'll listen"` is the original, `"Ship it"` is one phrase.
- **`settleAmount` defaults to 0**, so the default output matches the source's upright words.
  Non-zero adds a decaying rotational wobble for anyone who wants the "orbit" reading.
- **Per-phrase fit-to-frame**, measured from the laid-out text. One global scale is set by the
  longest phrase, which leaves a one-word phrase rendering tiny beside a three-word one.
- Stagger is capped at a quarter of the phrase divided by the word count, so a short duration
  cannot push the last word's entry past the point where it still has time to arrive.

### Verification

**Curve-fit accuracy** — the component's tables against the JSON's baked values, at matched
proportional timestamps (source frame `ip + (op - ip) * p`), two words each:

| quantity | max abs error |
|---|---|
| orbit sweep, `You` and `listen` | **0.000e+00 deg** |
| per-word scale-in, `You` and `listen` | 1.11e-16 x |
| group zoom (both nulls multiplied) | 2.32e-13 x |
| group rotation | 0.000e+00 deg |
| word world rotation vs component's 0 | 1.75e-02 deg |

The last row is the source's own bake residual (its composed chain wobbles by up to 0.017deg),
not the component's error — the component is exactly 0.

**Generalisation** — different word counts, phrase counts and durations, frame-sampled:

| render | frames | behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| source, 5.6s, 2x2 words | 170 (168+2) | phrase swap at t=0.5: ink 48005 -> 36504, centre jumps 964 -> 1025 |
| `Ship it fast`, 3.0s, 1 phrase | 92 (90+2) | three staggered entries, ink 11621 -> 110189 |
| `Design \| Build \| Ship it now`, 9.0s, 3 phrases | 272 (270+2) | swaps at t=0.35 and t=0.70, ink dropping 38263 -> 22869 and 47972 -> 69059 |
| four long words, 4.0s | 122 | fit engages: max bbox 1552x723 inside 1920x1080, never touching an edge |

Frame counts are exactly `duration * 30 + trailing`, so the timing is proportional rather
than clipped.

**Two defects caught by that sampling and fixed:**

- The final frame rendered **empty**. The visibility window used `progress < phraseEnd`, and
  the last phrase's end is exactly 1, so everything vanished on the last frame. The final
  phrase now runs inclusive of 1.
- Single-word phrases rendered much smaller than multi-word ones, because the fit was computed
  once over every word in the headline. Now per phrase.

`lower-third` still renders 89 frames at 1920x1080, unchanged; the service catalogue lists all
eight components.

### Deferred

- Word layout is a fixed diagonal step (0.82 x fontSize across, 0.85 down) derived from the
  source's hand-placed positions. Longer phrases therefore shrink to fit rather than rewrapping;
  a wrap-to-lines mode would suit long headlines better.
- The source's last two frames dip (linear null 125% -> 120%, eased 130% at 167.5). The tables
  keep it, so the reconstruction inherits a one-frame scale dip at the very end.
- The 3.5-frame entry offset of `talk` puts its orbit mid-key at 52.2% of its own span rather
  than 50%; the component uses 50% for every word. Difference is under half a degree.

## Stage 15 — `-Rep` suffix on custom components

Renamed the two components built in Stages 13 and 14:

| before | after (id) | after (name) |
|---|---|---|
| `turbulent-background` | `turbulent-background-Rep` | Turbulent Background Rep |
| `orbit-headline` | `orbit-headline-Rep` | Orbit Headline Rep |

The request named the first one `turbulent-bg-new`; no such id existed — the actual id was
`turbulent-background`, and that is what was renamed.

Each rename touched: the component directory (which `listComponents` requires to equal the
id), `meta.json`'s `id`, `name` and `project`, the project and scene filenames, the scene's
bundled-asset import path (`components/turbulent-background-Rep/assets/`), the `?scene` import
inside the project, the harness import and `PROJECTS` key, the `vite.config.ts` project list,
and two comments that named the old id. Uppercase in an id is safe: nothing on the
componentId path lowercases or sanitises it (the only `toLowerCase` in the service is on a
file extension).

Historical stage prose above still refers to the old ids, which is left as-is — those sections
record what was built at the time, and rewriting them would falsify the log. The convention
itself is at the top of this file.

## Stage 16 — deleted five components

Removed `animated-text`, `color-transition`, `logo-reveal`, `logo-reveal-v2` and `lower-third`
on request, leaving three: `stat-counter`, `turbulent-background-Rep`, `orbit-headline-Rep`.

Each deletion took the component directory, `src/projects/<id>.ts`, `src/scenes/<id>.tsx` and
their `.meta` sidecars, plus the `render-harness.ts` import and `PROJECTS` entry and the
`vite.config.ts` project entry. Beyond that, six places referenced the dead ids and would have
broken quietly:

- **`render-harness.ts` defaulted to `?? "animated-text"`** when no `project` query parameter
  was supplied — a deleted project. Now defaults to `stat-counter`.
- **`render-service/test/render-e2e.test.js` rendered `animated-text`** in four places: the
  catalogue assertion, the props-rejection case, the render itself and a prop echo check.
  Repointed to `stat-counter` (`label`/`accentColor` instead of `text`/`color`, and duration 2
  since `stat-counter`'s schema has `min: 2`).
- `render-service/test/sweep.test.js` used `"lower-third"` as a synthetic `component_metadata`
  fixture — cosmetic, updated anyway.
- The MCP `list_components` description named the old catalogue, and `generate_component`'s
  `componentId` example was `"lower-third"`. Both now describe the surviving three.
- Three READMEs: the component table and CLI example in `packages/component-library`, the curl
  example and test description in `apps/render-service`, and the test/CLI blocks in the root.
- `render.mjs`'s usage comment.

Not touched: `apps/editor/**` matches for "logo-reveal" and "lower-third" are the vendored
OpenReel fork's own template and motion-preset names (`branding-lower-third` and similar),
unrelated to our component ids.

**Live data note.** `lower-third` had 2 `component_metadata` rows and 2 saved projects
referencing it at deletion time (the Stage 12 swap-test projects). Those clips keep their media
and still render, but the Component Library panel can no longer re-render them, because
`POST /render` now 404s on that id. The rows were left in place rather than swept, since the
projects are still loadable.

Verified: `GET /components` returns exactly the three; `POST /render` 404s for all five deleted
ids; `stat-counter` renders 89 frames at 1920x1080 through the CLI and through the queue; the
render-service suite passes against the repointed component.

## Stage 17 — export judder: 1ms container timestamps vs a 1e-8 match tolerance

`orbit-headline-Rep` looked correct in the editor's live preview but visibly juddered in the
exported MP4, which nonetheless reported a clean 30fps. Same shape as Stage 7's alpha bug:
preview and export do not share a decode path.

### Isolation: the component render is fine, the project export is not

Ordered, before touching anything:

| step | finding |
|---|---|
| raw `render.mjs` webm, frame-by-frame | smooth — 170 distinct frames, no repeats |
| `ffprobe` on the raw webm | `r_frame_rate=30/1`, `avg_frame_rate=30/1`, 170 frames, **`time_base=1/1000`** |
| per-frame `pts_time` | `0.000 0.033 0.067 0.100 0.133 0.167 …` |
| the same instants at exact 30fps | `0.000000 0.033333 0.066667 0.100000 0.133333 0.166667 …` |
| exported MP4 | 30fps container, but 33 byte-identical consecutive frame pairs |

So: **a project-export bug**, not a component-generation bug. The generator is blameless; the
component's own bezier evaluator and phrase boundaries were never involved.

### Root cause

Matroska/WebM stores timestamps on a grid set by `TimecodeScale`, which defaults to 1ms.
1/30s = 33.333ms is not representable, so every frame lands up to 0.5ms away from its ideal
time; `-video_track_timescale` does not help, the WebM muxer ignores it.

`ExportFrameDecoder.getSequentialFrame` (`apps/editor/packages/core/src/media/mediabunny-engine.ts`)
asked for exact `k/fps` instants and matched them with `1e-8` of slack:

```ts
if (this.nextFrame && this.nextFrame.timestamp <= timestamp + 1e-8) { /* advance */ }
```

Frame 1 wants 0.033333 but is stored at 0.033 (accepted), frame 2 wants 0.066667 and is stored
at 0.067 — 0.33ms *late*, so it is rejected and the previous frame is emitted again. The next
request, 0.100000, then finds two frames ready and skips one. The result is a 3-frame
repeat/skip cycle: one third of the export is right, one third is a repeat, one third is a
skip. Structurally invisible to `ffprobe` — every output frame is on time, they just show the
wrong source frames.

Simulating both rules against the real timestamp lists reproduces it exactly, and predicts the
same 34% for every component in the library:

| source | frames | OLD `1e-8` | NEW rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orbit-headline-Rep` | 170 | `{0: 56, 1: 57, 2: 56}` — 34% clean | `{1: 169}` — 100% |
| `turbulent-background-Rep` | 92 | `{0: 30, 1: 31, 2: 30}` — 34% | `{1: 91}` — 100% |
| `stat-counter` | 96 | `{0: 32, 1: 32, 2: 31}` — 34% | `{1: 95}` — 100% |
| index-coded probe | 170 | `{0: 56, 1: 57, 2: 56}` — 34% | `{1: 169}` — 100% |

### Fix

One file. `TIMESTAMP_TOLERANCE = 0.0015` (1.5ms — three times the worst quantisation error,
and still under half of a 240fps frame), additionally capped at a quarter of the observed
frame spacing so it can never span a whole frame, applied to both forward comparisons. The
backwards-seek check keeps `1e-8`: erring towards a re-decode is cheap, erring towards a stale
frame is the bug being fixed.

### Two measurement traps hit on the way

1. **The fingerprint matcher was below its noise floor.** `corr.py` matched each exported frame
   to its nearest source frame by downscaled-grayscale MAD, and reported "78.7% clean" after
   the fix. Worthless: all 169 consecutive source pairs of `orbit-headline-Rep` differ by less
   than 0.5 MAD (median 0.011) while the encode noise is larger, so the matcher was choosing
   between indistinguishable candidates. Replaced by exact-duplicate hashing plus a
   purpose-built probe clip, and the rewritten matcher now prints its own separability and says
   `BELOW NOISE FLOOR, verdict meaningless` when the comparison cannot carry a conclusion.
2. **`${f%%:*}` split on the `C:` of a Windows path**, so a loop that looked like it measured
   three files measured one of them three times. Redone with explicit paths.

Also: cropping an export to its non-black bounding box is right for a pillarboxed 9:16 clip and
wrong for content that simply does not fill the frame (`stat-counter` is a caption on
transparency — cropping it gave a 76 MAD match error and nonsense correspondence). The matcher
picks full-frame or content-box by whichever aspect matches the source.

### Verification

**1. `orbit-headline-Rep`, the reported case.** Exact byte-identical consecutive frame pairs in
the export: **33 → 0**. Median frame-to-frame step restored from 0.008 to the source's 0.011.

**2. An index-coded probe, to remove all doubt.** 170 solid-colour frames encoding their own
index as `r = (i%16)*16+8`, `g = (i//16)*16+8` — a 16-level decision margin no lossy encode can
blur — muxed with the same ffmpeg arguments (`time_base 1/1000`). Read back through the
project export: **169/169 clean +1 steps, 0 repeats, 0 skips, first exported frame = source 0.**

**3. `turbulent-background-Rep` (9:16, pillarboxed in a 16:9 project), before and after on the
same project.** Source index per exported frame:

```
pre-fix   0 1 1 3 4 4 6 7 7 9 10 10 12 13 13 15 …   {0: 33, 1: 30, 2: 27}   32.6% clean
post-fix  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 …  {0:  4, 1: 85, 2:  1}   92.4% clean
```

Post-fix runs +1 unbroken over 0–65 and 69–89. The residue is content, not decode: this
component loops seamlessly, so its last frames genuinely match frame 0 (hence the `-89` step
and the identical source pair at index 90), and frames 66–68 are near-static in both exports.

**4. `stat-counter` — the predicted "affected but hidden by content" case.** Same project,
before and after:

```
pre-fix   0 0 0 2 3 3 6 8 8 9 10 10 12 13 13 15 16 16 …   {0: 46, 1: 22, 2: 23}   23.2% clean
post-fix  0 0 1 2 3 5 6 8 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 …   {0: 24, 1: 63, 2:  6}   66.3% clean
```

Post-fix, frames 15→66 are a perfect 52-step +1 run. The remaining repeats are all
content-explained: a 20-frame static tail once the counter lands (source frames 68–87 are
byte-identical to each other), the fade-in at the head, and the fade-out at the end. So yes —
**every component in the library was juddering**, `stat-counter` merely hides it behind fast
counting and a static tail.

**5. Trimmed clips: the tolerance corrects trims, it does not shift them.** Clip A at
`inPoint: 1` starts on source frame **30**; clip B at `inPoint: 1.0666667` — the quantisation-
affected case — starts on source frame **32**; both then step `{1: 29}`. Under the old rule
clip B started on frame 31, a stale frame.

**6. Chroma and true-alpha export regressions (Stage 4/6/12), same decoder, same files.** Both
150 frames, 5.000s, `r_frame_rate=30/1`:

| | t=0.5 | t=2.0 | t=3.0 | t=4.5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| chroma path — green px (whole frame) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| chroma path — white glyph px | 0 | 10,655 | 10,658 | 0 |
| chroma path — black px | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| alpha path — green px | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| alpha path — white glyph px | 0 | 8,405 | 8,415 | 0 |

Green nowhere, the centre row never green, the component present exactly while its band is on
screen and absent at 0.5s and 4.5s, no black rectangle. (Whole-frame counts here, against
Stage 12's 76,800-pixel band sample — a coarser but strictly stronger region, which is why the
8–12 stray edge pixels Stage 12 reported do not reappear.) The alpha path's 782/1,576 near-black
pixels at t=2/3 are the plate's own dark text edges, three orders of magnitude short of a
rectangle.

## Stage 18 — glyph-edge ripple: the alpha plane is quantised too

`orbit-headline-Rep` showed uneven, faintly rippling glyph contours at any zoom. Same
discipline as Stage 17: isolate the stage before touching a setting.

### The probe

The measurement is only as good as its reference, so the probe is chosen for provable
flatness rather than by eye. On frame 89 the left stem edge at **x=1307-1310 is
byte-identical on all 159 rows from y=194 to y=353** (alpha `0, 12, 192, 255`, blue
`0, 64, 77, 77`, every row). The raw ripple there is therefore *exactly* zero, and any
row-to-row variation downstream is the artifact, in luminance units. Renders are
deterministic, so the probe survives a re-render: frame 89's sha1 was identical across two
runs with the same props.

### Stage 1: the raw PNGs are clean

`0 0 0 0 12 192 255 255 255` across the edge - a clean two-pixel monotone ramp, no
overshoot, no undershoot, identical on every row. Ripple **0.000**. Motion Canvas
anti-aliasing is not involved.

### Stage 2: which encode setting

Ripple = row-to-row std of the composited value down the flat run, summed over the 4 edge
columns.

| encode | ripple over white | grey | black | alpha peak-to-peak | bytes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| raw PNG | **0.000** | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 | — |
| 4:2:0 crf 28 (was) | **7.255** | 3.626 | 0.590 | **35** | 375,102 |
| 4:2:0 crf 10 | 1.834 | 1.059 | 0.392 | — | 856,026 |
| **4:4:4** crf 28 | **7.370** | 3.796 | 0.725 | 35 | 459,502 |
| 4:4:4 crf 10 | 1.691 | 0.905 | 0.223 | — | 1,110,863 |
| 4:4:4 lossless | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0 | 4,258,514 |

**Chroma subsampling is not the cause.** 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 at the same CRF makes it very
slightly *worse* (7.255 to 7.370). **Quantisation is**: CRF 28 to 10 at the same 4:2:0 is a
4x reduction.

Recompositing the probe with one side's planes swapped separates the contributions instead
of inferring them:

| encode | actual | **alpha plane only** | colour planes only |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4:2:0 crf 28 | 7.255 | **7.303** | 0.516 |
| 4:4:4 crf 28 | 7.370 | **7.303** | 0.644 |
| 4:4:4 crf 10 | 1.691 | 1.561 | 0.223 |
| 4:4:4 lossless | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000 |

The alpha plane carries **~93%** of it, and its contribution is *identical* in 4:2:0 and
4:4:4 — as it must be, because VP9 stores alpha as a separate full-resolution greyscale
stream. That stream gets the same `-crf`. The raw alpha edge is `192` on all 159 rows;
decoded at crf 28 it wanders over `[177, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 201]`.

Alpha is not *mishandled* — nothing is premultiplied wrong or mismatched to colour. It is
merely quantised like any other plane.

### Colour-independent, so it is every alpha component

Re-rendered with `textColor: #ffffff`: alpha ripple **7.168 std / 29 p2p**, against
**7.422 / 35** for `#00004d`. What changes is only visibility — dark glyphs ripple against
light backgrounds, light glyphs against dark:

| glyph | over white | over grey | over black |
|---|---|---|---|
| `#00004d` | **7.255** | 3.626 | 0.590 |
| `#ffffff` | 0.470 | 3.572 | **6.698** |

### The fix: crf 20

`encodeWebm` in `scripts/render.mjs`. The sweep, all from one set of PNGs:

| CRF | ripple | alpha p2p | bytes | vs 28 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 0.942 | 2 | 1,434,271 | 3.82x |
| 12 | 2.685 | 5 | 765,194 | 2.04x |
| 16 | 2.771 | 6 | 621,028 | 1.66x |
| **20** | **2.953** | **8** | 536,335 | **1.43x** |
| 24 | 4.315 | 20 | 467,896 | 1.25x |
| 28 (was) | 7.255 | 35 | 375,102 | 1.00x |
| lossless | 0.204 | 0 | 3,746,016 | 9.99x |

4:4:4 was rejected: it removes 0.2 of ~7.3, costs 22% more bytes, and ffmpeg refuses
`yuva444p` without `-strict experimental` ("Pixel format 'yuva444p' is not widely
supported"), producing **Profile 1** files — an untested risk for the editor's decode path
for no visible gain. CRF is Profile 0 and `yuva420p` either way, so nothing downstream
changes.

### Verification

**Ripple, the pinned probe, identical PNG frames re-encoded both ways:**

| | ripple | alpha p2p |
|---|---|---|
| raw PNG | 0.000 | 0 |
| crf 28 | 7.255 | 35 |
| **crf 20** | **2.953** | **8** |

Exactly the sweep's prediction. Per component, on each one's own longest flat run (the
probe finds its own, so absolute values differ with content; alpha peak-to-peak is the
encode-level quantity that transfers):

| component | flat run | ripple crf 28 -> 20 | alpha p2p |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orbit-headline-Rep` | 158 rows, x 570-576 | 5.277 -> 3.173 | 27 -> 19 |
| `stat-counter` | 143 rows, x 758-764 | 7.177 -> 5.031 (over black) | 26 -> 7 |
| `turbulent-background-Rep` | 237 rows, x 0-6 | 3.388 -> 3.012 | 5 -> **0** |

`turbulent-background-Rep`'s residual 3.012 is identical over white, grey and black, so it
is colour-plane quantisation in dense photographic content, not alpha.

**Sizes, measured on identical PNG frames:**

| component | crf 28 | crf 20 | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orbit-headline-Rep` | 375,102 | 536,335 | 1.43x |
| `stat-counter` | 267,004 | 341,192 | 1.28x |
| `turbulent-background-Rep` | 570,949 | 1,016,507 | 1.78x |

1.28-1.78x, not runaway. `turbulent-background-Rep` is the outlier: a full-frame
photographic gradient under a turbulence warp is the hardest thing in the library to
compress, so a lower CRF costs it most.

### Does the project export compound it? No — it adds a different error

Both component encodes were put under a white background clip and exported to h264 (High,
yuv420p, ~4.2 Mbps). Measured on a wider 12-column window so an offset search had room;
**the best alignment was offset 0 for all four**, so the probe is valid at the export stage.

| stage | ripple | MAE vs ideal |
|---|---|---|
| ideal (raw over white) | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| component webm, crf 28 | 10.583 | 0.932 |
| h264 export of crf 28 | 8.344 | **1.850** |
| component webm, crf 20 | 5.901 | 0.446 |
| h264 export of crf 20 | 4.939 | **2.051** |

The export *lowers* row-to-row unevenness (8.344 < 10.583). It is not fixing anything: the
error against the ideal edge roughly doubles at crf 28 and more than quadruples at crf 20,
because h264's re-quantisation and deblocking low-pass the contour. Unevenness falls,
fidelity falls with it. **Reporting ripple alone would have read as the export improving
things**, which is why the MAE column exists.

Two conclusions. The component-side fix survives to the delivered file — final-export ripple
**8.344 -> 4.939** — and the export now contributes a roughly constant **~2 MAE** of its own
edge error regardless of component CRF, which is the floor on final edge fidelity. Lowering
that floor means the export's own encoder settings: a separate lever, untouched here.

## Stage 19 — the export's edge-fidelity floor is a decode-path difference, not an encoder setting

Stage 18 closed with a deferred item: the h264 export contributed a roughly constant ~2 MAE
of edge error regardless of the component's CRF, guessed to be "the export's own encoder
settings". That guess was wrong, and measuring it first is the only reason we did not spend
a change on it.

### The export's encoder settings, documented

Headless export goes `export-job-runner.ts` -> `WebCodecsBackend` -> mediabunny
`VideoSampleSource`.

| setting | value | reaches the encoder? |
|---|---|---|
| `codec` | `h264` -> `avc1.640028` (High, level 4.0) | yes |
| `bitrate` | `12000` -> **12 Mbps** | yes, and ignored |
| `bitrateMode` | `"vbr"` | **no** - never mapped to mediabunny's `'constant'`/`'variable'` |
| `quality` | `85` | **no** - only the still-image path reads it |
| `keyframeInterval` | `2` -> `2/30 = 0.067 s` | output has 2 keyframes in 93 frames, so not as written |
| `latencyMode` | unset -> WebCodecs default `'quality'` | — |
| `contentHint` | unset | — |
| `framerate` | never passed | — |

There is **no CRF equivalent in WebCodecs**. mediabunny's `Quality` constants are pure
bitrate calculators (`_toVideoBitrate`): for avc at 1080p, `QUALITY_MEDIUM` = 3 Mbps,
`HIGH` = 6, `VERY_HIGH` = 12. So `bitrate: 12000` is *already* the top of that scale.

### Every encoder lever is a dead end, measured in Chrome's own encoder

Probed `VideoEncoder` directly in the same headless Chrome with the same flags the export
worker uses, fed the **ideal** frames, read decoded frame 89 at the Stage 18 pinned probe.
(WebCodecs is gated on a secure context - on `about:blank`, `VideoEncoder` is simply not
defined, so the probe serves its page from `127.0.0.1`.)

| config | ripple | MAE | bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ideal | 0.000 | 0.000 | — |
| **current** | **3.179** | **0.642** | 1,428,714 |
| `bitrateMode: 'constant'` | 3.179 | 0.642 | 1,428,714 |
| `latencyMode: 'quality'` | 3.179 | 0.642 | 1,428,714 |
| `hardwareAcceleration: 'prefer-software'` | 3.179 | 0.642 | 1,428,714 |
| **`bitrate: 40 Mbps`** | **3.179** | **0.642** | **1,428,714** |
| `contentHint: 'detail'` / `'text'` | 11.957 | 0.929 | 533,217 |
| `prefer-hardware` | — | — | unsupported headless |

**Byte-identical output at 12 and 40 Mbps, and for CBR vs VBR** - the encoder ignores both.
`contentHint` is the only knob that changes anything and it makes the edge worse. Offline
libx264 confirms bits are not the constraint: fed the ideal frames at 2.0 Mbps it reaches
MAE 0.399, better than the real export at 4.1 Mbps.

### Attribution: most of the error arrives before the encoder

| stage | ripple | MAE | edge columns (row 0) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ideal | 0.000 | 0.000 | `[255.0, 243.2, 67.2, 5.6]` |
| ffmpeg decode of the webm | 5.901 | **0.446** | `[255.0, 241.3, 66.2, 5.6]` |
| **Chrome decode via `CanvasSink`** | 2.016 | **2.357** | `[255.0, 255.0, 52.7, 5.6]` |
| Chrome encoder, ideal frames in | 3.179 | 0.642 | `[255.0, 240.7, 69.8, 5.9]` |
| real export | 4.939 | 2.051 | `[254.8, 249.4, 50.9, 6.1]` |

The decode alone (2.357) exceeds the whole export's error (2.051); the encoder then softens
it slightly back toward the ideal.

### Which side loses the antialiasing step

Alpha across the probe edge, all of the same frame 89 of the same file:

```
raw render (ground truth)                [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 12, 192, 255, ...]
ffmpeg decode           (control)        [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 14, 193, 255, ...]
A  VideoSample.copyTo (raw BGRA buffer)  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 206, 255, ...]
B  VideoSample.draw(ctx)                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 206, 255, ...]
B2 toVideoFrame + drawImage              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 206, 255, ...]
C  CanvasSink({alpha:true})  (export)    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  0, 206, 255, ...]
D  HTMLVideoElement          (preview)   [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 14, 193, 255, ...]
```

**A, B, B2 and C are byte-identical**, so mediabunny's conversion is faithful - it passes on
exactly what it was handed, and the raw decoded buffer has already lost the step. **D matches
ffmpeg exactly.** So it is not mediabunny's conversion, and it is not "Chrome" as a whole:
it is specifically **Chrome's WebCodecs VP9-alpha decode**, while Chrome's `<video>` media
pipeline in the same browser is faithful.

Whole-frame confirmation, counting partially-transparent pixels (antialiased contour pixels)
per frame - a single window can miss the glyph entirely, as frames 40 and 60 did:

| frame | `CanvasSink` | `<video>` | ffmpeg | sink/video |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | 6,816 | 18,966 | 18,966 | 0.359 |
| 45 | 8,373 | 26,307 | 26,307 | 0.318 |
| 70 | 10,024 | 26,934 | 26,934 | 0.372 |
| 80 | 8,846 | 26,544 | 26,544 | 0.333 |
| 89 | 10,381 | 33,399 | 33,399 | 0.311 |

`<video>` reproduces ffmpeg's count **exactly on every frame**. `CanvasSink` keeps only
**31-37%** of the antialiased contour - fewer even than the raw render has, so it is
collapsing AA pixels to hard 0/255 rather than merely blurring them.

This is exactly why the preview looks clean and the export does not: `Preview.tsx` /
`video-engine.ts:479` draw alpha clips from an `HTMLVideoElement`, the export goes through
`CanvasSink`. The Stage 7 preview/export split, a third time.

One incidental confirmation of Stage 17 from inside this probe: `getSample(89/30)` returned
the frame at **2.933**, not 2.967 - the 1 ms container grid biting a fresh piece of code.
The probe asks for `89/30 + 0.002`.

### Decision needed, and it is not a small one

The decoded format is `BGRA` with `matrix: "rgb"`, `fullRange: true` - Chrome hands back
packed RGBA for alpha-bearing VP9 rather than planar I420A, so there is no separate
full-resolution alpha plane for us to read instead. Whether feeding `VideoDecoder` directly
would avoid this is **untested**, and unpromising for that reason: mediabunny already uses
`VideoDecoder`, and the BGRA buffer *is* what it produced.

Options, none free:

- **Switch the export's decode to the `<video>` path.** Fixes fidelity outright. Re-opens
  frame accuracy, which is precisely what Stage 17's tolerance fix bought - `<video>`
  seeking is tolerant by design (the probe requested 2.968667 and landed on 2.968666). Any
  attempt needs the Stage 17 index-coded probe as its gate.
- **Probe a direct `VideoDecoder` path** for an I420A output. One more read-only experiment,
  low expected yield.
- **Render components on chroma green and key them** (the Stage 4/6 path, still supported).
  Sidesteps alpha decode entirely and reintroduces keying artifacts, which is what Stage 7
  existed to remove.
- **Accept the floor.** ~2 MAE of edge error on alpha components in exports, preview clean.

Deferred pending a decision. Nothing changed in the export path.

### Option 2 result: a faithful, frame-accurate decode path does exist

mediabunny exposes the WebM alpha side data per packet (`packet.sideData.alpha`,
`packet.alphaToEncodedVideoChunk()`), and VP9 alpha is itself a valid greyscale VP9 stream.
Driving a second `VideoDecoder` over just those chunks, with the track's own decoder config:

| | format | planes | probe row 194, cols 1303-1315 |
|---|---|---|---|
| raw render (ground truth) | — | — | `[0,0,0,0,0,12,192,255,255,255,255,255]` |
| ffmpeg decode (control) | — | — | `[0,0,0,4,0,14,193,255,252,253,255,255]` |
| `CanvasSink` (today's export) | BGRA | 1 | `[0,0,0,0,0,0,206,255,255,255,255,255]` |
| **alpha stream, own `VideoDecoder`** | **I420** | **3** | **`[0,0,0,4,0,14,193,255,252,253,255,255]`** |

Cropped to the display width, the decoded alpha plane is **bit-exact with ffmpeg over the
whole frame**: 0 of 2,073,600 pixels differ, max absolute difference 0, and the partial-alpha
count matches at 33,399 to 33,399. The colour stream decodes to `I420` as well
(`fullRange: false`, so it needs a proper limited-range BT.709 conversion if we ever compose
it ourselves).

Two details that cost measurement time and would bite an implementation:

- `codedWidth` is **1984**, not 1920 — VP9 pads width to a multiple of 64. Scanning the coded
  width reported exactly 64 extra partial-alpha pixels on every one of five frames; a constant
  offset across unrelated frames was the clue that it was padding, not content. **Crop to
  display width.**
- All 92 packets carry alpha, and their timestamps are the file's own ms grid
  (`0, 0.033, 0.067, 0.1, 0.133, …`), so this path keeps frame accuracy: Stage 17's tolerance
  logic applies unchanged and no `<video>` seeking is involved.

So Option 1 stays rejected and Option 4 is not needed: the fix does not have to trade
fidelity against judder. What it costs is a second VP9 decode per exported frame.

### Option 2 implemented: alpha repair in ExportFrameDecoder

`ExportFrameDecoder` now keeps taking colour *and frame selection* from `CanvasSink`, and
overwrites only the alpha channel from a second `VideoDecoder` driven over the alpha side
data. One file, 278 added lines, nothing else touched.

Armed only when it can help and can be trusted: the track must expose alpha side data
(opaque clips pay nothing and change not at all) and the canvas must be 1:1 with the source.
A scaled or letterboxed canvas - a 9:16 component in a 16:9 project - would need the alpha
plane resampled through CanvasSink's own `fit` geometry, and getting that subtly wrong is
worse than not repairing, so it is skipped. Any failure disarms repair for the rest of the
export rather than failing the export.

Frames are matched on **the canvas frame's own timestamp**, not on the requested time, so
the "last frame at or before" rule stays in exactly one place and the two streams cannot
drift apart.

#### Two implementation bugs, both caught by instrumenting rather than guessing

1. **Premature EOF in the pump.** The first version fed 8 packets per pump and treated "all
   packets fed" as "stream finished". The consumer discards frames before the one it wants,
   so the queue empties transiently - and the loop concluded the stream was over while the
   wanted frame was still in flight, having already discarded it. Symptom: repair armed,
   `matched: 0`, output byte-identical to before. Input is now fed only while decoded frames
   are outstanding (bounded by `MAX_IN_FLIGHT`), and the loop waits for output instead of
   concluding.
2. **Per-batch flush is invalid.** The second version forced output with `flush()` after each
   batch, and a code comment asserted that flush does not require a key packet afterwards.
   Chrome disagreed, in as many words: `DataError: Failed to execute 'decode' on
   'VideoDecoder': A key frame is required after configure() or flush().` `flush()` is now
   used exactly once, at end of input, where nothing follows it. `reset()` + `configure()` on
   a backwards seek is fine because the seek lands on a key packet by construction.

#### Gate results

Gates 1-4 were run against the real `ExportFrameDecoder`, imported into a page on the editor's
own dev server through Vite's `/@fs/` endpoint, rather than against a re-implementation.

**Gate 1 - edge fidelity at the pinned probe.**

| | ripple | MAE vs ideal |
|---|---|---|
| ideal | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| CanvasSink (before) | 2.016 | **2.357** |
| **with repair** | 6.080 | **0.692** |
| ffmpeg's own floor | 5.901 | 0.446 |

MAE **2.357 -> 0.692**, 3.4x, against ffmpeg's floor of 0.446. The probe row is now
byte-identical to ffmpeg. Ripple *rising* to 6.080 is correct rather than a regression:
CanvasSink's low 2.016 came from having flattened the edge to hard 0/255, and 6.080 is
ffmpeg's 5.901 - the right amount of variation for a real compressed edge. Reading ripple
alone would have called this a regression, which is why Stage 19 added the MAE metric.

The residual 0.25 above ffmpeg is the **colour** channel, deliberately left alone: Chrome
zeroes colour where its own alpha was zero, and only alpha is restored. Visible only for a
bright glyph on a dark background.

**Gate 2 - whole-frame antialiased-contour count, exact on all five frames.**

| frame | with repair | ffmpeg | CanvasSink (before) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | **18,966** | 18,966 | 6,816 |
| 45 | **26,307** | 26,307 | 8,373 |
| 70 | **26,934** | 26,934 | 10,024 |
| 80 | **26,544** | 26,544 | 8,846 |
| 89 | **33,399** | 33,399 | 10,381 |

**Gate 3 - frame selection, the hard blocker.** The Stage 17 probe (`idx.webm`) is `yuv420p`,
so it only exercises the disarmed path. A second probe codes the frame index into *both*
streams - colour in an opaque half, where readback is exact, and alpha in two patches, where
it is exact whatever its value - so a colour/alpha misalignment shows as a mismatch instead
of having to be inferred. (A first attempt read colour through a partial alpha; unpremultiplied
readback at alpha 159 destroyed the 16-level nibble margin and the probe reported failures of
its own making.)

```
idx.webm  (opaque, repair disarmed)  169/169 clean +1 steps, first frame index 0
idxa.webm (alpha,  repair armed)     169/169 clean +1 steps, first frame index 0
                                     alpha index == colour index: 170/170
```

**Gate 4 - Stage 12 regressions, at decoder level.** `green-lt.webm` carries no `alpha_mode`,
so the chroma path leaves repair disarmed and is unaffected by construction.

| clip | metric | decoder | ffmpeg |
|---|---|---|---|
| green-lt (disarmed) | green px @ t=2 | 1,939,924 | 1,939,924 |
| green-lt | white glyphs | 10,395 | 10,367 |
| alpha-lt (armed) | alpha 0 / partial / 255 | 1,937,843 / **129,882** / 5,875 | 1,937,843 / **129,882** / 5,875 |
| alpha-lt | green px | 0 | 0 |

The alpha histogram matches ffmpeg bucket for bucket. The 0.1-0.3% glyph-count differences
are canvas-versus-PNG rounding in the colour conversion.

**Gate 5 - wall clock.** Measured on the decode stage specifically; end-to-end export time is
dominated by encoding and headless-Chrome startup and would bury the change.

```
92 sequential getFrame() calls, alternated, 3 passes each
  repair OFF: 4276, 5402, 5330 ms   mean 5003
  repair ON : 6586, 6541, 6624 ms   mean 6584
  overhead: 1581 ms total, 17.19 ms/frame, 32% slower on the decode
```

**+17.19 ms/frame, +32% on the decode**, which is +1.6s on a 92-frame clip - roughly
**+12-16% end-to-end** against the 10-13s exports, and **zero for opaque clips**. Accepted:
a 3.4x fidelity gain for ~15% on alpha clips only.

#### Gates 4 and 5, end-to-end — CLOSED

Run later, once Docker was back. The same project (a transparent `orbit-headline-Rep` over a
white background clip, 92 frames) exported through the real queue with the repair armed and
then disarmed in place, interleaved on one machine, measured at the same pinned probe:

| | ripple | MAE vs ideal | bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| repair disarmed | 4.939 | **2.051** | 1,589,464 |
| repair armed | 7.660 | **0.790** | 1,577,104 |

**MAE 2.6x better in the delivered file.** The disarmed run reproduces the pre-repair
measurement from this stage *exactly* (4.939 / 2.051 / 1,589,464 bytes), which is what
validates the whole chain rather than just the new number. Ripple rising is correct and is the
Stage 19 lesson repeating: the disarmed export has less row-to-row variation because CanvasSink
flattened the antialiasing, and MAE is the metric that sees through that.

**Wall clock (gate 5, end-to-end):** armed `10.0, 10.5, 10.0` (mean 10.17s), disarmed
`10.1, 10.1, 9.9` (mean 10.03s) — **+0.13s, +1.3%**, less than the spread within either group.
So the +32% *decode-stage* cost measured earlier is invisible at the export level, and the
"+12-16% end-to-end" estimate in this stage was pessimistic: encoding and headless-Chrome
startup dominate, and the extra VP9 decode hides inside them.

**Chroma path:** byte-identical to Stage 12 — 3,379,403 bytes across the Stage 12, Stage 20 and
this export, with every green/white/black count unchanged. An opaque render leaves the repair
disarmed, now confirmed end-to-end rather than only from reading the code.

A whole-frame visual check at the same time found nothing the probe would have missed.

The Docker failure that originally blocked this, kept for the next time it happens:

> `starting services: initializing Inference manager: listening on
> unix://<HOME>\AppData\Local\Docker\run\dockerInference: remove ...dockerInference: The file
> cannot be accessed by the system.`

Not a disk or WSL problem - H: had 341 GB free, `H:\Docker Disk\DockerDesktopWSL` existed and
`wsl -d docker-desktop echo ok` worked. Two orphaned entries in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Docker\run\`
(`dockerInference`, `userAnalyticsOtlpHttp.sock`) cannot be stat'd, bound or removed. A reboot
cleared it both times it happened, and is the first thing to try.

### The pattern behind Stages 17-19

All three traced to one theme: **preview and export do not share a decode path.** Preview
draws alpha clips from an `HTMLVideoElement` (`video-engine.ts:479`); export goes through
mediabunny's `CanvasSink`. Stage 7's alpha bug, Stage 17's judder and Stage 19's ripple are
the same split showing up three times, and each looked like something else first - an encoder
setting, a component bug, a conversion bug.

**When a new preview/export discrepancy appears, check for a decode-path split before
anything else.**

## Stage 20 — `render_preview_frame` painted over the footage: `CanvasSink` without `alpha: true`, again

An MCP agent doing real work found that `render_preview_frame` returned a black frame for a
transparent component, and worked around it by re-baking the component on a solid background.
Functional, but every future agent would hit the same wall, so it was worth chasing.

### The reported cause was a red herring

The agent pinned `video-engine.ts:684`, where the canvas is filled black before the clip loop.
That fill is legitimate — "canvas background fill behind letterboxed clips… drawn before the
clip loop so contained clips composite on top" — and **`export_project` runs through the very
same `renderFrame` and the same fill**, correctly. It is what you see, not what causes it.

Nor was the symptom what it looked like. At t=2 the preview showed the lower-third's plate,
glyphs and accent bar all correctly alpha-composited, while the **footage track was entirely
absent**: 99.2% of the frame black. The component's transparency was not "lost inside a black
rectangle" — its whole 1920x1080 bitmap came back **opaque**, and being on the top track it
painted over everything below.

### Root cause

`MediaBunnyEngine.getFrameAtTime` built `sinkOptions = { poolSize: 1 }` — no `alpha: true`.
`CanvasSink` defaults to an opaque canvas, so a VP9 `alpha_mode=1` clip decodes with black
baked into every transparent pixel. Measured on one blob at one timestamp:

| branch | transparent | partial | opaque | pixel at (100,100) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fallback `getFrameAtTime` | 0 | 0 | **2,073,600** | `[0,0,0,255]` |
| `ExportFrameDecoder` (`alpha: true`) | 1,937,843 | 129,882 | 5,875 | `[0,0,0,0]` |

The right-hand row is ffmpeg's ground truth exactly.

**Why only the preview broke:** `renderFrame` prefers `getExportDecoder(mediaId)` and falls back
to `getFrameAtTime`. The export primes `createExportDecoder` for every video item before its
loop; `render_preview_frame` primes nothing. One shared function, two branches — and the
fallback branch never received Stage 7's fix.

So this is **not** another preview/export decode-path *split* like Stages 7/17/19. It is the
same *bug family* (a `CanvasSink` missing `alpha: true`) at the one call site Stage 7 missed.

### Four hypotheses falsified before getting there

Recorded because each looked plausible and cost time:

| hypothesis | how it died |
|---|---|
| the footage's blob never hydrated | both hydrate — 389,839 and 68,312 bytes, neither a placeholder |
| the footage fails to decode | both return 1920x1080 through the fallback |
| a cold-start race, one frame rendered too early | three consecutive calls byte-identical |
| track hidden / not visual | `hidden: false` both, render order `["Video 2","Video 1"]`, `visual: true`, opacity 1, scale 1, no effects |

Only then did reading the *alpha channel* of the decoded bitmaps — rather than the composited
result — separate "opaque bitmap" from "lost transparency".

### The fix, and the guard

One line: `alpha: true` in `getFrameAtTime`'s sink options. Two callers, both of which want it:
`video-engine.ts:337` (the `renderFrame` fallback) and `exportFrame()` (single-frame image
export). `generateThumbnails`, `generateFilmstripThumbnails` and `exportImageSequence` build
their own sinks and are deliberately left opaque — they produce standalone images, not layers.

Because this is the **fourth** appearance of the same class, it is now closed structurally
rather than by vigilance. `src/media/canvas-sink-alpha.test.ts` reads the source and asserts
every `CanvasSink` construction either passes `alpha: true` or is named in a
`DELIBERATELY_OPAQUE` map with a reason. A new, unclassified call site fails until someone
decides which it is, and a stale exemption fails too. Mutation-tested four ways — removing
`alpha: true` from `getFrameAtTime` (the Stage 20 bug), removing it from `ExportFrameDecoder`
(the Stage 7 bug), adding a fresh unclassified site (a hypothetical fifth), and renaming an
exempted method — each fails the matching assertion, and the suite is green when restored.

### Verification

**1. `render_preview_frame`, same project, t=2.**

| | near-black | white glyphs | row 100 (pure footage) |
|---|---|---|---|
| before | 2,057,921 / 2,073,600 (99.2%) | 8,417 | `(0,0,0) (0,0,0) (0,0,0)` |
| **after** | **294 / 2,073,600 (0.0%)** | 8,417 | `(254,159,14) (35,71,167) (25,67,174)` |

Visually indistinguishable from the export. `getFrameAtTime` itself now returns
transparent 1,939,887 / partial 121,062 / opaque 12,651 with `[0,0,0,0]` at (100,100), against
ffmpeg's 1,937,843 / 129,882 / 5,875 — the right shape, with a residue noted below.

**2. Export regression — and the export was quietly affected too.** The chroma path is
byte-identical to Stage 12 (white glyphs 10,655 / 10,658, green 0, black 0). The true-alpha
path *changed*: near-black at t=2/3 went 782/1,576 to **6/0**, with the difference confined to
the component's own footprint (y 763-919, x 488-1409) and the rest of the frame identical.
Judged against the ideal composite — ffmpeg's faithful component over the real footage — on the
129,882 partially-transparent pixels:

| | MAE vs ideal |
|---|---|
| before (`29.mp4`) | 6.225 |
| **after (`38.mp4`)** | **2.474** |

So the export is **2.5x more correct**, not regressed: it was intermittently falling through to
`getFrameAtTime` as well (a primed `ExportFrameDecoder` returns null on some frames, and the
chain then retries through the fallback), baking black into the component's semi-transparent
edges. This is why "the export looks fine" was never quite the whole story.

**3. Live preview, both mechanisms.** `decodeClipFrame` (`Preview.tsx:2347`) decodes through
`document.createElement("video")` + `currentTime` and never reaches `getFrameAtTime` — untouched
by construction, which is what Stage 7 established. The **bridge path**
(`Preview.tsx:2615` to `render-bridge.ts:178`) calls `videoEngine.renderFrame`, the same
function verified in item 1, so **it improves too**. Verified structurally, not by pixels: two
attempts to drive the live preview headlessly measured nothing usable, because a dynamic
`import()` of the store or the bridge resolves to a *different module instance* than the running
app's, and the first `<canvas>` in the DOM is not the bound preview surface. Worth knowing
before anyone tries to test the live UI this way again.

**4. Suites.** core typecheck clean; core `media`/`video`/`export` 185 passed, 5 skipped;
render-service 13/13; project-kit 27/27; mcp-server 8/8.

### Residue, deliberately not fixed here

`getFrameAtTime` now returns *correct* transparency but not *maximally faithful* transparency:
121,062 partial pixels against ffmpeg's 129,882, with the surplus pushed to hard 0/255 — the
exact signature of the Stage 19 mechanism (Chrome's WebCodecs VP9-alpha decode collapsing
antialiased alpha). Stage 19's parallel-decoder repair lives in `ExportFrameDecoder` only.
Porting it to this path is a separate, smaller decision: it affects preview fidelity, not
correctness, and the black-rectangle bug is what was in scope.

### The pattern, for the fifth time it happens

`CanvasSink` defaults to an opaque canvas. **Any** sink whose output gets composited over
another track must pass `alpha: true`, or transparency becomes black and — on a top track —
erases everything below. Stage 7 (export decode), Stage 19 (alpha fidelity in that decoder),
Stage 20 (the `renderFrame` fallback). The guard test now enforces it; if it ever fails, the
answer is in this section rather than a fresh investigation.

## Stage 21 — the audio-gap bug that wasn't, and what the symptom actually was

An MCP agent doing real work reported that audio is encoded in 15s chunks and that a chunk with
no content is skipped instead of written as silence, shifting all later audio earlier. It came
with evidence: a correlation of 1.0 between the first 4s of a broken export and the packshot's
own audio, -0.17 against the intended music, plus a "control" export of an earlier project that
came out fine.

**No such bug exists.** The `continue` is real and sits at `export-engine.ts:965`, but it cannot
shift anything, for three independent reasons:

- `hasAudio` in `renderTimelineAudio` is **project-level** —
  `timeline.tracks.some(t => !t.muted && trackHasAudioItems(project, t.id))`. If the project has
  audio anywhere, it is true for every chunk.
- `renderDuration` is always > 0 inside the loop: `currentChunkDuration` is
  `min(chunkDuration, timelineDuration - startTime)` and the loop guard is
  `startTime < timelineDuration`.
- `renderAudio` **always returns a full-length buffer**. It builds
  `new OfflineAudioContext(channels, ceil(safeDuration * sampleRate), sampleRate)` — sized to the
  requested window — and renders clips into it. An empty window is a full-length *silent* buffer,
  never a short one and never null.

So the only way to reach that `continue` is a project with no audio at all, where every chunk is
skipped uniformly: no shift, just no audio track. Confirmed on real exports — a silent-webm
project yields `0,h264,video` only, while a project with audio yields `0,h264,video` +
`1,aac,audio`.

### Measured, not argued

Three exports with tone-coded audio, read back per second as RMS + dominant frequency, so each
window is unambiguous without correlating against anything:

| scenario | timeline | audio placed at | measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| gap covering a whole chunk | 45s | 440Hz 0-10s, 880Hz 30-40s | 440 at 0-10, silence 10-30, **880 at 30**, silence 40-45 |
| gap at the start | 45s | 880Hz 20-30s | packshot's own 220Hz at 0-10, silence 10-20, **880 at 20** |
| three empty leading chunks | 60s | 880Hz 50-60s | 50s of silence, **880 at 50** |

The first is the hardest case for the reported mechanism: the gap covers the whole 15-30s chunk,
so a skipped chunk would have pulled 880Hz to 15s. It landed at 30s.

### What the agent actually heard

Scenario two reproduces their correlation result exactly. A video clip's **own embedded audio is
mixed into the export**, as in any NLE. The music was never displaced; the packshot's audio was
simply *also* present where they expected silence or music. That is why their `volume: 0`
workaround fixed it — and `set_clip_transform { clipId, volume: 0 }` is the supported control,
already in the op vocabulary and honoured at `audio-engine.ts:363`. Rebuilding the audio bed with
ffmpeg was never necessary.

The op vocabulary now says so explicitly, since the omission is what cost the detour: a clip's own
audio is mixed by default, `volume: 0` silences it, and silence in an audio track is exported as
real silence so gaps and a short music bed stay in sync.

### The defensive change, and a bug in the insurance itself

The mechanism was wrong but the failure mode is worth guarding: a later "skip chunks with no
content" optimisation would reintroduce exactly the reported shift. So the loop now writes a
silent buffer instead of `continue`, and the project-level "has any audio" check moved *above*
the loop, so a null inside it can only mean "this chunk had no content" and a silent project
still gets no audio track.

The first version of that insurance was worse than the bug it guarded. `createSilentAudioBuffer`
used the DOM `AudioBuffer` constructor, which is absent under Node, so it **threw** — skipping the
pre-muxing cache release and failing a pre-existing test ("keeps decoder caches warm while
throttling browser exports", 1 clear instead of 2). It now returns null where no `AudioBuffer`
constructor exists and the loop falls back to the old skip: insurance must not be the thing that
breaks the export.

### Verification

- Nine tests appended to `export-engine.test.ts`: seven gap shapes (including audio starting and
  ending exactly on a chunk boundary) asserting the written chunks sum to the timeline duration,
  one asserting empty chunks are written as 15s of silence rather than skipped, one asserting a
  project with no audio still writes nothing.
- Mutation-tested: reintroducing the skip fails 7; removing the project-level guard fails 1;
  restored, 41/41 pass in that file.
- End-to-end after the change: the gap project re-exports with the identical tone layout, and the
  no-audio project still produces a video-only file.

## Stage 22 — project folders

One free-text folder per project, no predefined structure. A column on `projects`, plus a
filter, a folder list, an MCP param and grouping in the Projects panel.

### Where the routes actually live

Worth recording because it is not obvious: `GET/POST /projects`, `PUT /projects/:id` and
**`DELETE /projects/:id`** are in `routes-storage.js`, while `routes-ops.js` holds
`POST /projects/new`, `/ops`, `/export` and `/frame`. Folder plumbing therefore touches both.
The delete endpoint exists and sweeps orphaned media afterwards — earlier in this session it
was wrongly reported as missing, from checking only `routes-ops.js`, and two rounds of test
cleanup went through raw SQLite as a result. Use the endpoint.

### Migration: NULL, presented as "Uncategorized"

`ALTER TABLE projects ADD COLUMN folder TEXT` through the same tolerant try/catch already
used twice for `media`. **No backfill.** The column stores NULL and the API reports
`DEFAULT_PROJECT_FOLDER`:

- nothing to half-apply across existing rows;
- NULL keeps "never categorised" distinguishable from "deliberately filed under a folder
  called Uncategorized", which a backfilled literal would erase forever;
- the default lives in one place, the row-to-object mapping, so it cannot drift between
  `listProjects` and `getProject`.

The consequence needing care: `?folder=Uncategorized` has to match NULL rows, so that filter
special-cases the default to `folder IS NULL OR folder = ?`. It has its own test.

Verified on the real database: all 25 pre-existing projects reported `Uncategorized`
immediately, and one opened with its tracks and media intact.

### Not an ops verb, and not in the project JSON

`rename_project` is in the ops vocabulary, so the precedent cuts both ways. The distinction:
`project.name` **is part of the composition** — it shows in the editor title bar and is
written into the exported file's metadata (`output.setMetadataTags({ title: project.name })`).
A folder affects nothing about the video; it describes the stored record, and project-kit is
"pure-JSON project manipulation" with no concept that a record exists. Hence no
`set_project_folder`, and `packages/project-kit` has **zero** changed files.

Risk decided it as much as taxonomy. In the JSON, every save path would have to carry the
field; `getFullProject()` spreads `...project` so it probably would, but the editor's
`Project` type does not declare it and anything reconstructing rather than spreading would
drop it — silently resetting a folder on save, the exact failure class this session kept
hitting. As a column, `upsertProject`'s `DO UPDATE SET name, data, updated_at` cannot touch
it, so an editor save provably cannot clobber a folder.

Cost: an agent sets a folder at create time but cannot re-file through ops. `PUT` can re-file,
so the capability exists; only the ops route lacks it.

### A bug the tests caught: two states, one NULL

The first `upsertProject` used `folder = COALESCE(excluded.folder, projects.folder)` to make
an omitted folder leave the stored one alone. That works for "omitted" and breaks "clear it":
`folder: undefined` and `folder: ""` both reduce to SQL NULL, so COALESCE cannot tell them
apart and the explicit clear silently did nothing. Now two statements — identical except for
whether `DO UPDATE` touches `folder` — chosen on `folder !== undefined`.

Mutation-tested four ways: always writing folder fails the "omitted must not clear" test;
never writing it fails three; dropping the NULL branch from the default filter fails the
uncategorised test; storing the label instead of NULL fails two.

That exercise also found a **gap in the tests themselves**. "Never write folder" initially
failed only one test, because a fresh INSERT always carries its folder from the VALUES clause —
only updates go through `DO UPDATE`. So setting a folder on an existing project, which is what
re-filing does, was untested. Two tests added; the same mutation now fails three.

### Verification

All seven, against the running service unless noted.

| | result |
|---|---|
| 1. create with an explicit folder | stored and returned by create, `GET /projects/:id` and `GET /projects` |
| 2. create without one | `Uncategorized` on read; create echoes no folder at all |
| 3. `?folder=` | 2 rows for a two-project folder, 1 for a one-project folder, 0 for an unknown one, and the default folder includes never-categorised rows |
| 4. `GET /projects/folders` | `["Client Acme","Internal Tools","Uncategorized"]`, distinct and sorted |
| 5. MCP round-trip | `create_project` with folder → echoed and persisted (read back from HTTP, not from the tool reply); `list_projects` carries folder on all 28 projects and filters to 2; the `-MCP` suffix still applies |
| 6. Projects panel, real browser | three folder sections, default sorted last, per-folder counts in the headings, folder name on every row, filter with 4 options, selecting one leaves one section, clearing restores three |
| 7. pre-folder project | listed, opens, and loads with 2 tracks and 2 media |

Two things were verified rather than assumed, both flagged before implementing:

- **Route shadowing.** `/projects/folders` against `/projects/:id` returns
  `{"folders":[…]}`, not `{"error":"Unknown project"}`. find-my-way prefers static segments,
  and a real request confirms it — had it shadowed, the folder list would have looked like a
  client bug.
- **`upsertProject` not nulling folder.** Asserted at the unit level and again end-to-end: a
  `PUT` carrying only name and project leaves the folder intact, and the rename still applies.

Suites: render-service 26/26 (13 new), project-kit 27/27 with zero changed files, mcp-server
15/15, core and web typechecks clean.

### One thing the UI run got wrong

The panel assertion first failed on names, expecting a `-MCP` suffix. The app was right: those
fixtures were created over plain HTTP, not through MCP, so they correctly have no suffix. The
assertion was wrong, not the grouping.

## Installed tooling — animation design skills

`npx skills add emilkowalski/skill` (2026-09-10). Emil Kowalski's motion/design-engineering
skill pack, MIT-licensed, pure Markdown — no runtime dependency, nothing imported by any
package, nothing in `package.json`.

**What it is for:** a design/taste reference for the *next* Motion Canvas component we add to
`packages/component-library` — easing-curve choice, duration heuristics, and above all the
"should this animate at all" gate. It is a judgement aid, not a code generator for this repo:
its recipes assume CSS/Framer Motion in a DOM, whereas our components are Motion Canvas
generators rendered headless, so the *reasoning* transfers and the snippets do not.

**Where it landed:** payload in `.agents/skills/<name>/`, with `.claude/skills/<name>` as a
**symlink** into it. A lockfile `skills-lock.json` at the repo root pins each skill by source
and content hash. 12 skills, 276 KB.

`.agents/skills/` and `skills-lock.json` are **tracked**, so a fresh clone contains the skills
rather than just this note. `.claude/skills/` is **gitignored** — see below.

The six asked for are all present — `emil-design-eng`, `animate`, `review-animations`,
`improve-animations`, `find-animation-opportunities`, `prototype` — plus six that came with
the pack: `animate-expo`, `animation-vocabulary`, `apple-design`, `ask-sonner`,
`pick-ui-library`, `write-swift`. The last three are irrelevant here (React Native, Sonner
toasts, Swift); left in place rather than pruned, since deleting them would desync
`skills-lock.json`.

Two things to know before relying on it:

- **Three are user-invoke-only.** `prototype`, `review-animations` and `pick-ui-library` carry
  `disable-model-invocation: true`, so an agent cannot reach for them on its own — they run
  only when you ask for them by name. The other nine can be picked up autonomously. Worth
  knowing before wondering why a review did not happen: nobody asked for it.
- **`.claude/skills/` holds symlinks, so it is gitignored.** Git would store the link itself,
  and a checkout on a machine without symlink support (Windows without Developer Mode) turns
  it into a text file containing a path — a skill directory that reads as one line of garbage.
  Tracking the payload and the lockfile instead sidesteps that entirely: re-run
  `npx skills add emilkowalski/skill` after a clone and it rebuilds the links from the pinned
  hashes. That directory held nothing else, so ignoring it costs nothing.

Upstream is MIT, but the installed payload ships **no LICENSE file** of its own; the pinned
hashes in `skills-lock.json` are the only provenance record on disk.

Committed **exactly as the installer wrote it**, which means CRLF — the only CRLF files in an
otherwise LF repo. Deliberate: this is vendored third-party content that `npx skills add`
rewrites wholesale on update, so normalising it would produce a diff the next install silently
reverts. `computedHash` in the lockfile matches neither the as-is nor the LF-normalised sha256
of the file, so it is not a plain content hash and cannot be used to argue that normalising is
safe. If the CRLF ever becomes noisy, `.agents/skills/** -text` in `.gitattributes` is the fix,
not a bulk rewrite.

## Stage 23 — the chat bubble components

`chat-bubble-single-Rep` and `chat-thread-Rep`, ported from ui-animation's balloon bubble and
chat screen. Two things made this different from the earlier component work: the silhouette is
real Bézier geometry rather than a rounded rectangle, and the bubble's size is an *input* to
that geometry, so the text measurement had to be ported too.

### The extraction report was mostly right, and wrong in five places

Every constant was re-read from source before use. Confirmed: the seven shape knobs, the
textbox block, padY 12/14, both palettes, the shadow, the 240ms entrance with its
translateY/scale/origin, cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1), the gaps, the typing formula, the dot
sizes and wave. Wrong or missing:

1. **Dot stagger is 0.184s, not 0.16s.** `STAGGER` is added to the *phase*
   (`(t/PERIOD + i*STAGGER) % 1`), so the wall-clock offset is 0.16 x 1.15.
2. **`MULTILINE_AT` is a height threshold**, `textH >= 2.5 x lineHeight`, not "3+ lines". The
   source says why: it "stays honest when a line box renders taller than the nominal".
3. **`HOLD_OUT = 1.6` was missing entirely** — it is part of the total duration, so a thread
   built from the report alone finishes 1.6s early.
4. **The sideCollapse framing was backwards.** With cornerInset 32 an axis collapses at 72px
   or below, and a single-line bubble is ~45px tall, so collapsed-vertical is the NORMAL case
   and a short bubble is a 4-anchor lens. The 8-anchor topology is the exception, not the rule.
5. Missing details that fidelity needs: dot gap 5px, dot row 19px, and the `*action*` italic
   convention (whole-message asterisks, stripped and italicised).

Confirmed as asked: **there is no exit animation.** `enterStyle` returns an empty style once
the entrance completes and nothing touches the bubble again, so the clip holds.

### Fidelity by numeric identity, not by eye

`buildBubble` was already pure maths, so it is ported nearly verbatim and the port is checked
by *identity*: same (W, H) into both copies must give the same path string. Over a 420-pair
grid covering all three topologies (130 four-anchor, 213 six, 77 eight) the path data and every
read-out match **exactly**. Mutation-tested six ways — BETA_MAX, the collapse comparison, the
arc-handle exponent, the corner-handle leg and the bow's driving dimension all diverge on
15-170 pairs.

The sixth mutation, **removing the convexity clamp, changed nothing** — so it was measured
rather than assumed: instrumenting the source shows the clamp fires **0 times** across those
420 shapes at the shipped `cornerHandle: 0.6`, and 1680 times at 3.0. It is a guard for
parameter values this component never uses. Ported faithfully, permanently inert.

The entrance curve is exact to the source (max error 0.0) and within 1.6e-13 of an independent
200-iteration bisection — worth 1.6e-12 px of the 10px travel. The port earns its keep:
easeOutQuint would be off by 0.017 and easeOutCubic by **0.198** of the span.

### The measurement is the part that could silently be wrong

The silhouette is drawn around the measured text box, so a wrap that differs from the browser's
makes the shape wrong however exact the maths. The greedy wrap is reproduced with canvas
`measureText`, including the source's deliberate `ceil(widest) + 1` subpixel guard. Checked
against a real DOM element carrying the source's exact CSS: **line counts match on all 9
strings**, including a mid-word break and the tight-fit case where the ported width (189) is
narrower than the browser's unpinned box (220) and still wraps to the same two lines.

Rendered pixels then agree with the geometry sub-pixel: analytic path extent 135.00 x 46.51
against a measured bbox of 135.00 x 46.67. The vertical spill is *less* than the nominal
sagitta because `edgeFullness: 0.4` flattens the bow to 40% of a true arc — expected, not drift.

### Two implementation bugs worth recording

- **`Path` does not centre where I assumed.** It subtracts `childrenBBox().center` from its
  computed layout, and I read that as "the rect centre lands on the node position". It does
  not: the first render put the silhouette a full half-size down-right of its own text. Fixed
  by emitting pre-centred path data, which makes the bbox centre ~(0,0) and the question moot.
- **`document.fonts.check()` returns true for a font that does not exist.** An earlier
  `ensureFont` used it to skip redundant loads, so it skipped the load entirely and then failed
  its own probe. It reports whether a query can be satisfied *somehow*, fallback included — the
  one question not worth asking. The width probe is the real gate.

### The font is a substitute, and the gate that proves it loaded

Pangea Text is licensed and this repo is public, so it is **not** vendored. DM Sans (OFL 1.1)
stands in, chosen by measurement: x-height 504 vs 505, cap 700 vs 700, `n` 574 vs 575 — the
closest of the 46 weight-400 upright faces already in this repo. Same call orbit-headline-Rep
makes for Widescreen-Bold. Registered under the private family name "DM Sans Rep" so a machine
with DM Sans installed cannot mask a load failure. Swapping back is two constants in
`chat-font.ts`.

The render pipeline had **no font-readiness gate at all**, which is exactly how a missing face
ships silently: the text renders in a fallback, every bubble measures differently, and the
silhouette is drawn to match. `ensureFont` now awaits the face and then proves it by width
probe. Both failure modes were tested by deliberately breaking them — a 404 URL, and a face
registered under a name nothing asks for. Both throw with the font and URL named; the
unmodified control still renders.

Also worth knowing: `?url` imports do not work in this package — the Motion Canvas plugin turns
them into a request that serves the raw binary as a module. Plain asset imports work.

### Scale, and the one convention deliberately broken

Everything is built at fontSize 16 (scale 1), where every constant is as tuned, and the whole
node is then scaled to fill the frame. Raising fontSize would NOT enlarge the bubble: `maxWidth`
is absolute by design in the source, so a bigger font wraps into more lines inside the same
220px column.

`durationInSeconds` stretches the pauses and the hold but **pins the 240ms entrance**, against
this library's usual everything-scales-proportionally rule. The source's own comment settles it:
UI motion stays under 300ms, and "a dropdown that takes 400ms feels broken". `paceFor` solves
for the pace that lands the total on the requested duration given that fixed cost; asked for
less than the entrances alone, it overruns rather than rushing them.

### Verification

| | result |
|---|---|
| 1. geometry | 420 pairs, path data and read-outs identical; 5/6 mutations caught, 6th proven inert |
| 2. curve | exact to source (0.0); 1.6e-13 vs independent bisection; named easings off by 0.017 / 0.198 |
| 3. colour and font | `#ffffff`/`#242433` and `#00004d`/`#ffffff` sampled exact from both senders; DM Sans renders; gate throws on both failure modes |
| 4. thread timing | typing per-message at both clamps and between; whole timeline identical to the source's `buildTimeline` (delta 0) on 4 threads; 7/7 mutations caught; gaps measured 6.13/11.82/6.13 against 6/12/6; typing windows frames 20-62 and 95-137 against a computed 19-62 and 95-137 |
| 5. generalization | 6 messages at 15s (452 frames) and 2 at 4s (122 frames), pipe separator, auto-alternation, italic action |
| 6. standard checks | both in `GET /components` at 1080x1080 and 1080x1920, `-Rep` suffix, every param documented, delimiter scheme spelled out in the param description |

Suites: render-service 26/26, mcp-server 15/15 (its catalogue guard test covers the new
components), project-kit 27/27.

One measurement artefact worth noting, since it looked like a bug: the typing-window detector
first reported the dots appearing 4 frames late. The dots were on time — the detector required
alpha >= 250 and an exact width, and during its own 240ms entrance the bubble is still fading
and scaled to 0.94. The instrument was wrong, not the render.

`tsc --noEmit` is not a usable gate in this package: the `?scene` / `?project` virtual modules
and the JSX runtime produce the same errors for the three pre-existing scenes. The new files add
no new error categories.

### Stage 23a — closing the unmeasured entrance claims

Stage 23's verification covered geometry, the curve, colour and timing, and asserted the
entrance's transform-origin, scale, translateY and opacity as implemented. Three of those were
read off the source rather than measured. A hypothesis that the corner anchoring was wrong —
that the port interpolated the scale as a number without repositioning the node, so the bubble
grew from its centre instead of its corner — forced them to be measured properly. Result: the
hypothesis was **falsified**, and a different defect in the same family turned up.

**Anchoring is correct.** `entranceTransform` already computes the compensating translation
(`corner * (1 - scale)`), which is the identity that turns Motion Canvas's origin-anchored
scale into CSS's corner-anchored one. Measured per-edge at 60fps across the entrance, because
`transform-origin: 0% 100%` pins the left and bottom edges while translateY still slides the
bottom on a known schedule:

| | received | sent |
|---|---|---|
| anchored edge | left, drift **0px** | right, drift **0px** |
| free edge | right, travels 30px | left, travels 29px |
| bottom vs predicted `10*(1-eased)` | worst error 0.8px | worst error 0.8px |

The free edge travelling 30 rather than the naive 41px is the first *visible* frame: frame 0
has opacity 0, so measurement starts at eased 0.286 (scale 0.9572), giving 0.0428 x 192 x 3.6
= 29.6px.

**Opacity is correct, and the test could tell the difference.** The source uses the same eased
value for the fade as for the transform, not a separate linear ramp. Measured peak alpha
against both hypotheses: worst error **0.0017** vs the eased curve (which is 8-bit
quantisation) and **0.543** vs a linear fade — 310x apart, so the measurement is decisive
rather than merely consistent.

**The real defect: canvas shadows do not scale with the node.** `shadowBlur` and `shadowOffset`
are applied in the canvas's coordinate space and are NOT transformed by the CTM, unlike CSS
`filter: drop-shadow()`, which scales with the element. These bubbles are built at scale 1 and
the whole node is zoomed 3.6x to fill the frame, so the shadow stayed at design size:

    before: reach 21px below the bubble   (device-space, 3.6x too tight)
    after:  reach 77px                    (CSS-equivalent ~86px; the rest is the Gaussian tail)

A shadow 3.6x too tight reads as flatter and harder-edged than the original — the kind of
mismatch that looks slightly wrong without anything looking broken. `applyShadowScale` fixes it,
called from each scene once the zoom is known (it depends on the bubbles' measured heights, so
it cannot be known at build time).

Residual, accepted: during the 240ms entrance the node also scales 0.94 -> 1.0 and CSS would
scale the shadow with that too. That is a 6% error on the shadow for 240ms; correcting it means
writing the shadow every frame, which is not worth it.

Re-verified after the fix: anchoring unchanged, fills still exactly `#ffffff`/`#242433` and
`#00004d`/`#ffffff`, thread gaps still 6.13/11.82/6.13 against 6/12/6, typing windows still
frames 20-62 and 95-137.

**The lesson, which is the reason this entry exists:** three properties were reported as
verified in the same table as things that had actually been measured. Two turned out right and
one turned out wrong, and no reader of that table could have told which was which. A claim read
off the source is a different kind of claim from one read off pixels, and mixing them in one
list of checkmarks is what let a 3.6x shadow error sit under a "verified" heading.

## Stage 24 — multi-line text params

Two components carry several items in one text param: orbit-headline-Rep's phrases (joined
with "|") and chat-thread-Rep's messages (newline, with `rep:` / `me:` prefixes). The
param vocabulary has no array type and is not gaining one — an agent still sends a single
delimited string — but a person editing by hand should not have to remember the delimiter.

### Schema

Three optional fields on a text param, passed through untouched because the API returns
meta.json verbatim (`components.js` validates prop *values*, never the param shape):

    "multiline": true,
    "lineSeparator": "|",
    "lineHint": "One phrase per line. ..."

Applied to exactly two params. `stat-counter`'s `label` and `chat-bubble-single-Rep`'s `text`
are genuinely single-line and were left alone.

`chat-thread-Rep`'s separator is `"\n"` rather than `"|"`, even though its parser accepts
both: newline is what a person types, and it round-trips through the textarea unchanged.

### A textarea, not a list of line inputs

The decision that mattered was where the canonical value lives. The panel already keeps
`values[param.key]` as one joined string and restores it straight from a clip's stored props
on re-open. So the textarea renders `value.split(separator).join("\n")` and joins back on
change, and **nothing else had to change** — the submit paths, the re-render flow and the
"split it back for editing" requirement all fall out of that one substitution.

A dynamic add/remove list would have needed a `lines[]` state per param kept in sync with the
string, which is a second source of truth and a new way to desync. It is also worse for the
actual use: people paste multi-line chat text.

### MCP-facing consistency

Each param's `description` — the prose MCP surfaces — now states the delimiter rule in the
same terms as the `lineHint`, so the friendly UI wording and the API documentation cannot
drift apart. The `lineSeparator` field gives an agent the same answer as data.

While verifying, the `list_components` **tool description** turned out to be stale in the
other direction: it named "a stat counter, a 9:16 turbulent background, an orbit headline"
and had never learnt about the two chat components. Stage 19's guard test catches quoted ids
that do NOT exist; it cannot catch components that exist and are not mentioned. Fixed
structurally rather than by adding the two names — the description no longer enumerates
components at all, so it cannot go stale again.

### Verification

All five, against the running stack in a real browser.

| | result |
|---|---|
| 1. orbit-headline-Rep | textarea; default shows as two lines; typing three lines sent `"First phrase\|Second phrase\|Third phrase"` |
| 2. chat-thread-Rep | textarea; hint names the prefixes; a sender-prefixed thread sent newline-joined, byte for byte |
| 3. re-open an existing clip | generated, added to a track, selected: the stored string came back as three editable lines |
| 4. stat-counter's `label` | still `<input type=text>`, no hint |
| 5. MCP round-trip | `list_components` carries both descriptions in prose, plus the three new schema fields |

Verifications 1 and 2 assert the **outgoing request body**, not the field's state: that payload
is the contract between the field and the renderer, so reading it settles whether the join is
right. Suites: mcp-server 15/15, render-service 26/26, web typecheck clean.

Two things the harness got wrong before the app did, both worth recording because the next UI
test will hit them:

- **Request interception slows every load through CDP.** A fixed 5.8s wait that was ample
  without it fired before the panel had rendered, and the run reported "the panel does not
  open" when it opened fine. Wait for the control, never for a duration.
- **The Component Library is a tab inside the assets panel**, not a rail icon, and generated
  media carries its component in a module registry keyed by media id — the clip is only
  stamped with `componentId`/`props` once it reaches a track. Two probes were written against
  guesses at both before checking the DOM and the source.

### Stage 24a — the prefix vocabulary is rep:/me:

`received:` / `sent:` (and `r:` / `s:`) became `rep:` / `me:` (and `r:` / `m:`). "rep" is the
companion, short for the product name; "me" is the user's own side — which is what the source
called it internally (`from === "me"`), so the new vocabulary is closer to the original than
the one it replaces. A clean replacement, not an alias: the component had no real usage beyond
verification renders, and two parallel vocabularies would be worse than either.

**The rename stops at the parsing boundary.** The internal `Sender` values stay
`"received"` / `"sent"`, because the palette and the alignment are keyed on them, so
`balloon-bubble.tsx` — the file holding the colour and side mapping — has a **zero diff**.
That is the strongest available form of "the mapping did not change": not a re-verification,
an unchanged file. The pixel check was run anyway, since the request touched adjacent code.

Verified: rep -> `#ffffff` / `#242433` / left and me -> `#00004d` / `#ffffff` / right, sampled
exactly from a render using both long and short forms, and again from an unprefixed thread to
confirm alternation still opens on the rep side.

**Where the old forms went:** they are now ordinary text, asserted rather than assumed —
`parseThread("received: hi")` yields one message whose *text* is "received: hi". Also asserted:
`maybe: tomorrow` and `report: done` are not eaten by the `m:` and `rep:` prefixes, since the
regex requires the colon immediately after the marker.

One thing worth knowing for the next colour check: **a webm cannot be used to assert an exact
hex.** Sampling the UI-generated file showed `#252231` where the source frame had `#242433`,
which looked like a rename bug. It is the VP9 encode: re-sampling the encode of the very same
verified-exact PNG frames reproduces the shift. Exact-hex assertions belong on the renderer's
PNG output; the webm is lossy by design.

Left inconsistent on purpose, pending a decision: `chat-bubble-single-Rep`'s `sender` param
still takes `"received"` / `"sent"` as its values. It is a different param on a different
component and was outside this rename's scope, but the two components now describe the same
two sides with different words.

### Stage 24b — the single bubble's sender param follows

`chat-bubble-single-Rep`'s `sender` values became `rep` / `me` (with `r` / `m`), so both
components describe the same two sides with the same words. Colour and side mapping untouched
again — `balloon-bubble.tsx` still has a zero diff across both renames.

**`readSender` is now strict, and that was the point.** It used to read anything starting with
"s" as the sent side, so `"sent"` would have gone on working as an undocumented alias — the
exact outcome a clean rename is meant to avoid — and any unrecognised value would have
silently rendered as the companion: wrong colour, wrong side, nothing to show it. It now
accepts only `rep` / `r` / `me` / `m` and throws otherwise, naming the valid values and
saying the old ones were renamed.

Verified: `rep` renders `#ffffff` / `#242433` on the left and `me` renders `#00004d` /
`#ffffff` on the right, sampled exactly from PNG frames. `received`, `sent` and `nonsense`
each fail the render with that error and write no output file; `r` and `m` still render, as
the control that the rejection is about the value and not about strictness in general.

## Stage 25 — manual folder assignment in the editor

Stage 22 built the folder backend and a read-only display. This adds the two write paths a
person needs: choosing a folder when saving, and re-filing an existing project.

### A folder-only route, because the list holds summaries

`PUT /projects/:id` requires the whole project object, so a folder-only body 400s. That could
have been worked around by sending a cached project — except the panel's list carries
*summaries*, not project JSON, so re-filing a project that is not currently open would mean
fetching the entire blob to change one column. Hence `PUT /projects/:id/folder`, backed by
`setProjectFolder`, which touches only that column and `updated_at`.

It deliberately takes no `expectedUpdatedAt`: moving a project between folders does not
conflict with someone editing its contents, so the optimistic-concurrency guard would only
produce false conflicts. A test asserts the project JSON is byte-for-byte unchanged after a
re-file — a move that quietly rewrote a composition would be far worse than one that failed.

Six tests, mutation-tested four ways: not reporting an unknown project fails 1, skipping
normalisation fails 2, not bumping `updated_at` fails 6, writing the wrong column fails 4.

### One control, not two

`FolderPicker` is a text input backed by a `<datalist>` — a native combobox, so the dropdown
offers what exists and anything typed is a new folder. A `<select>` plus a separate "new
folder" field would make reuse and invention look equally heavy and need a mode switch. The
default folder is filtered out of the options: it is a presentation of "no folder", not
somewhere to file into, and clearing the field already does that.

### The endpoint finally has a caller, and it is provably the source

`GET /projects/folders` had **two** wrappers and zero call sites — `listServerProjectFolders`
in the editor and `service.listProjectFolders` in the MCP server, neither ever invoked.
(`?folder=` was never dead, though: MCP's `list_projects` passes it. An earlier note in this
session called both dead; only the folders endpoint was.)

The pickers are now fed by it rather than by folders derived from the loaded projects, which
matters because the two only agree by coincidence. Proved rather than asserted: the
verification intercepts that response and injects a folder no project is in, then checks it
appears in the picker and does NOT appear as a grouped section.

### Verification

All five, in a real browser, plus the server-side filter as a cross-check.

| | result |
|---|---|
| 1. save into an existing folder | the PUT carried `folder: "Existing Client"`, and the server reports that folder for the id the app actually saved |
| 2. save into a typed new folder | folder created, project in it, offered by the picker with no app reload, and `GET /projects/folders` agrees |
| 3. re-file via the card's Move action | one `PUT .../folder` with body `{"folder":"Existing Client"}` and no project JSON; panel updates; survives a full reload |
| 4. the picker's data source | an injected endpoint-only folder shows in the picker and not as a section |
| 5. regression | grouping, per-folder counts, default sorting last, filter narrowing and clearing all still work; the server-side `?folder=` count matches the client-side filter exactly (6 vs 6) |

28 assertions. Suites: render-service 32/32 (6 new), mcp-server 15/15, project-kit 27/27, web
typecheck clean.

### Three harness defects that looked like product bugs

Worth recording, because each cost a run and the next UI test will meet them:

- **An `aria-label` collision I created.** The save picker was labelled "Folder for the next
  save", and the folder sections are labelled `Folder <name>` — so a selector for
  `[aria-label^="Folder "]` found a phantom section called "for the next save", which skewed
  five assertions. That was a real naming defect, not just a test problem: a screen-reader
  user hearing "Folder for the next save" among "Folder Client Acme" has the same ambiguity.
  Renamed to "Save into folder".
- **The editor's project identity is still settling when the panel renders.** It restores its
  autosaved project asynchronously, so `project.id` read just before a save is not
  necessarily the id the save writes to — reading it earlier or later does not fix that. The
  test now asserts against the id in the PUT the app itself issued, which is by definition
  the project that was saved.
- **Project names are not unique in this database.** Earlier stages left several projects
  called `MCP-claude-test-2-MCP`, so a name-based "is it gone from Uncategorized" check fails
  because a *different* project of that name is still there. Identity assertions go through
  ids.

## Stage 26 — exit animations

New design, not a port: the source has no exit at all. So the question was not "what does the
original do" but "what can we derive from it", and the answer is the entrance, backwards.

### exitTransform is one function read in two directions

`exitTransform(exited) = entranceTransform(easeOut(1 - exited))`. It is a call into the
entrance's own transform, not a second implementation, so the symmetry is a property of the
code rather than a claim about it.

**The easing has to sit inside the mirror.** The request's formula was
`entranceTransform(1 - t / EXIT)`, which drops it — the entrance is
`entranceTransform(easeOut(p))`, so mirroring the raw progress instead of the eased one gives
a *linear* exit. Measured, that formulation diverges from a true time reversal by up to
**6.18px of translate, 0.54 of opacity and 0.033 of scale** — endpoints identical, middle
visibly wrong. Corrected before building.

### Fitting it into the duration

`EXIT` is aliased to `ENTER` rather than given its own 0.24, because two constants that happen
to be equal can drift apart. `EXIT_STAGGER` is 0.12, the interval orbit-headline-Rep already
uses for its words: half the exit duration, so consecutive bubbles overlap by 50% and the
thread reads as one wave leaving rather than a queue being served.

- **Single bubble:** entrance, hold, exit. The hold absorbs the slack. Below 0.48s there is no
  hold left and the *entrance* truncates — the exit is never clipped, because a clip ending
  mid-disappearance looks broken in a way a slightly clipped arrival does not. The param's own
  minimum is 0.5s, so the validated range never gets there.
- **Thread:** the exit joins `paceFor`'s fixed cost
  (`n×ENTER + (n−1)×EXIT_STAGGER + EXIT`), so only the pauses are elastic and the wave is
  structurally unclippable. The single pace factor is kept rather than special-casing the hold
  to collapse first: that model is already verified end to end, and a marginally nicer
  degenerate case is not worth replacing it.
- **Bubbles leave from where they sit.** `layoutAt` keeps every arrived bubble in its row
  through the exit; re-laying out the stack as bubbles went would make the survivors jump
  around mid-wave.

The full mirrored transform is used for the thread, not the plain-fade fallback that was
allowed: rendered and looked at, the staggered corner-anchored shrink reads cleanly, because
each bubble collapses toward its own side while its neighbours hold still.

### Verification

| | result |
|---|---|
| 1. symmetry | 1001 samples × 2 senders × 3 sizes: worst delta **1.4e-14** (float round-off from the mirror's one subtraction — both directions call the same function). 4/4 mutations caught |
| 2. exit in pixels | monotonic 1.00 → 0.29 → 0, largest single-frame step 0.29 (a pop would be ~1.0), anchored-edge drift **0px**, and the mirror holds **frame for frame: delta 0.0000** at every sampled instant |
| 3. stagger order | 3 messages: half-faded at 7.733 / 7.867 / 8.000, strictly oldest-first; bubble 0 gone at 7.767 as the last starts at 7.760 |
| 4. generalization | 5 messages at 14s: strictly ordered, last bubble finishes exactly at 14.000; schedules land on target for both 8s/3 and 14s/5 |
| 5. regression | entrance anchoring 0px drift both senders, opacity ramp 0.0017 vs the eased curve (0.543 vs linear), fills exactly `#ffffff`/`#242433` and `#00004d`/`#ffffff`; balloon-geometry.ts, text-measure.ts and chat-font.ts all have a **zero diff** |

Timeline regression rewritten around the change rather than relaxed: it now asserts the
arrival schedule is still **identical to the source's** (delta 0) and that our duration is the
source's *plus exactly the exit wave*. 16 new exit-wave assertions on top.

### Two things the measurement got wrong first

- **"Exact by construction" was too strong.** Both directions do share one function, but
  sampling the mirror needs one subtraction, and `1 - (EXIT - s)/EXIT` is not bit-identical to
  `s/EXIT`. The residual is 1.4e-14 — physically zero, but not zero, and the test now says so
  with a stated tolerance instead of claiming exactness it does not have.
- **A symmetry test cannot see a change made to both sides at once.** Mutating the shared
  `(1 - eased) * 10` to `* 14` left symmetry perfectly intact — correctly, since that is what
  shared implementation means. The gap was real though: the entrance's own magnitudes were
  unpinned by this test. Endpoint assertions now pin the 10px travel alongside the 0.94 scale,
  and that mutation is caught.

Also worth keeping: the renderer emits **one frame past the duration** (92 frames for a 1.5s
clip at 60fps), so "the last frame" is not `t = duration`. An index-based mirror is off by one
because of it; pair frames by time.

## Stage 27 — word-highlighted captions

Captions animate word by word, in the preview and in exports, from real Whisper word
timestamps where the model can produce them and from an estimate where it cannot.

### What was already there, and why none of it worked

The fork shipped most of a word-highlight feature that could never run:

- `caption-animation-renderer.ts` implements six styles (word-highlight, word-by-word,
  karaoke, bounce, typewriter, none) against `Subtitle.words`.
- Nothing ever populated `Subtitle.words`. The Whisper panel asked for
  `return_timestamps: true`, which is one timestamp per sentence-ish chunk.
- Nothing ever populated `timeline.subtitles` either: `subtitle/add` exists in core
  with a validator, an executor and an inverse, and has no callers anywhere. Both the
  Whisper panel and SRT import route through `addSubtitle`, which creates a TEXT CLIP
  on a "Captions" track. Export reverses that, deriving SRT back out of text clips.
- The inspector's animation-style dropdown read `selectedSubtitle` from that empty
  array, so it could not affect anything, and its "re-generate captions to enable
  animation" hint pointed at a path that never produced word timings.
- The animated renderer was wired into the preview canvas only. Export draws text
  through `video-engine`, which drew captions as plain text.

So the feature was built on `timeline.subtitles`, and the product uses text clips. The
work here moves it onto the side that is actually used, and leaves the subtitle system
untouched and dead rather than deleting it.

### Where the animation lives now

`words` and `animationStyle` are fields on `TextClip`; `highlightColor` and
`upcomingColor` are on `TextStyle`. `titleEngine.renderText` draws the word row, which
matters: **the preview and the export both render text through `renderText`**, so one
implementation serves both and the two cannot drift. This is the same class of bug as
Stage 7 and the `render_preview_frame` alpha bug, and the fix is the same shape - make
export use the shared path instead of its own simplified one.

Word times are **clip-relative** (0 = clip start), unlike `Subtitle.words`, which is
absolute. The words belong to the clip, so moving a caption keeps it in sync with
itself.

Gaps between words are reserved from `MAX_WORD_SEGMENT_SCALE`, not from the current
frame's scale: a highlighted word grows about its own centre, and sizing the gaps per
frame made the row twitch as the highlight travelled.

### Every caption gets word timing

`deriveWordTimings` shares a cue's duration across its words in proportion to spoken
length (punctuation stripped, since it is not spoken). It is an estimate, and it is
what SRT imports, hand-typed captions and the fast Whisper model get. Real timestamps
overwrite it rather than merging. New captions default to `word-highlight`.

### Only one of the two Whisper models can do word timestamps

`whisper-large-v3-turbo_timestamped` can. `whisper-tiny` **cannot**, and does not
degrade - the whole transcription throws:

> Model outputs must contain cross attentions to extract timestamps. This is most
> likely because the model was not exported with `output_attentions=True`.

Word timings are extracted from decoder cross-attentions, which only the
"_timestamped" builds are exported with. `supportsWordTimestamps` on the model
definition decides what the worker asks for; a model without it gets segment
timestamps and its captions fall back to the proportional estimate.

Measured on 7.2s of synthesised speech, against ffmpeg `silencedetect` on the source:

| boundary | audio | Whisper | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| first sentence ends | 2.721s | 2.70s | 21 ms |
| second sentence starts | 3.748s | 3.28s | 470 ms early |
| speech ends | 6.373s | 6.34s | 33 ms |

Ends of phrases land within ~30ms. The **start** of a phrase after a pause runs early,
because Whisper anchors the first word to the end of the preceding silence rather than
to the onset of speech. In practice the highlight lights the first word of a sentence
about half a second before it is spoken. Trimming a word's start to the next
`silencedetect` edge would fix it and has not been done.

### Known external dependency: the model CDN is not ours

`whisper-worker.ts` hardcodes `https://media.openreel.video/models/` - the upstream
vendor's infrastructure, not ours. Inference is fully local and no audio leaves the
machine, but the **first-run download** depends on a third party who has no obligation
to keep serving it. If it disappears, auto-captions stop working for anyone who has not
already cached a model.

Re-hosting is a config change plus storage. Measured from the CDN:

| model | encoder | decoder | tokenizer | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| large-v3-turbo_timestamped | 405.3 MB | 318.7 MB | 2.4 MB | ~726 MB |
| whisper-tiny | 8.6 MB | 82.7 MB | 2.4 MB | ~94 MB |

About **820 MB** for both, or ~726 MB for just the model that supports word timings.
The work is: mirror the files, serve them from render-service (or any static host)
under the same `{model}/resolve/{revision}/` layout, and point `env.remoteHost` at it.
Worth doing before anyone depends on captions in production; the files are too large
for the git repo, so they would need a storage directory and a fetch script.

## Stage 28 — automatic server saves, duplicate guard, version history

### Why

A day's editing sat in one browser while the server copy stayed two days old.
Three projects had local IndexedDB autosaves ahead of their server rows, because
saving to the server was a button someone had to remember to press.

### Saving is automatic now

`ServerSyncManager` rides the dirty signal the project store already emits: 2s
after the last edit, throttled to one write per 5s while editing continues,
backing off to 30s past 2MB. Flushes on hide, on blur, and once more during
unload with `fetch(keepalive)` — under 64KB, which real projects are.

Kept separate from `AutoSaveManager` on purpose. Local autosave is the
last-resort net; it must not be slowed or made noisy by a flaky network, and the
two want different cadences. They share the dirty signal and nothing else.

A 409 stops the loop and surfaces rather than retrying, because auto-retrying
with the server's newer timestamp is how another session's work disappears. The
one exception is a phantom — the server's copy being exactly what we last sent,
meaning our own write landed and we never saw the response — which rebases
silently.

The concurrency baseline moved from `ServerProjectsPanel`'s component state into
the store: saving no longer depends on that panel being mounted.

Pristine projects are skipped, so opening the editor creates nothing. The first
real edit brings a project into being server-side.

### Three layers, three jobs

| layer | cadence | scope | job |
|---|---|---|---|
| IndexedDB autosave | 2s | this browser | crash recovery, works offline |
| server sync | ~5s | current state, all devices | the server has my latest |
| version history | ~10min + manual | history, all devices | take me back to this morning |

No overlap: local is sub-second and disposable, sync has no memory, versions are
coarse history with no current-state role.

### Version history

`project_versions` holds whole project JSON per checkpoint — at ~12KB a project,
diffing saves little and buys a reconstruct step that can fail.

Checkpoints, not saves: one per "Save now", one per 10 minutes of editing
(`AUTO_VERSION_INTERVAL_MS`), one immediately before a restore. Automatic syncs
write every few seconds and would otherwise produce thousands of unreadable rows.

Restore snapshots what it replaces as `pre-restore` and writes the old content
through the ordinary upsert, so a restore is undoable and the restored state is
just a normal current state — editable, syncable, versionable.

Retention mirrors `sweepExports`: keep the newest 30 **per project**, plus
anything under 7 days, plus manual versions under 30 days. Per project so a busy
one cannot evict a quiet one's history. Measured cost at 12KB/version: ~360KB per
project at the cap, ~18MB across 50 projects — less than one exported MP4.

Deleting a project deletes its versions. The delete dialog says it cannot be
undone, and restorable history would make that a lie.

**The subtle part: sweeps must treat version blobs as references.** Both
`findOrphanedMedia` and `sweepRenderedFiles` now scan version JSON as well as the
current project rows. The media a person removed from the timeline this morning
is exactly what a naive sweep collects — the moment before they reach for the
history to get it back. There is a test for precisely that.

### create_project no longer mints duplicates

The project list accumulated `Agent Built` three times and
`MCP-claude-test-2-MCP` twice: `create_project` generated a fresh uuid every call
and compared nothing. It now returns the existing project when the name and
folder both match, with `reusedExisting: true`, and `allowDuplicateName` for when
a second one is genuinely wanted. Matching on name *and* folder: two "Intro"
projects under different clients are different work.

Enforced server-side for the same reason the `-MCP` suffix is — a convention an
agent has to remember is one that gets dropped.
