# @video-editor/component-library

Motion Canvas scene-components, rendered to **transparent WebM (VP9, `yuva420p`)** for the video
editor's Component Library panel. Standalone npm project — no workspace coupling, so it can be lifted
out of this repo unchanged.

## Components

| id | params (`type` from OpenReel's `MotionVariable` vocabulary) |
|---|---|
| `stat-counter` | `label: text`, `targetNumber: number`, `accentColor: color`, `durationInSeconds: number` |
| `turbulent-background-Rep` | `backgroundPreset: text`, `image: media`, `scale`/`offsetX`/`offsetY`, `displacementAmount`, `noiseScale`, `durationInSeconds` — renders 9:16 (1080x1920) by default |
| `orbit-headline-Rep` | `text: text`, `fontFamily: text`, `textColor: color`, `durationInSeconds`, `zoomAmount`, `driftAmount`, `settleAmount`, `staggerSeconds` |
| `button-<style>` (ten: `pulse-glow`, `shimmer`, `outline-draw`, `fill-sweep`, `ghost-float`, `press-3d`, `bounce-in`, `blink-flash`, `gradient-flow`, `ripple-rings`) | shared: `text: text`, `backgroundColor: color`, `textColor: color`, `fontSize`, `positionY`, `durationInSeconds`, plus one or two per style (e.g. `glowColor`, `pressInterval`). Each auto-sizes to its measured text via `src/lib/cta-button.tsx`; defaults live in `src/lib/cta-button-defaults.ts` — renders 9:16 (1080x1920) by default |

Custom components carry a `-Rep` suffix on id and display name (see the Conventions section of
NOTES.md). Five earlier components — `animated-text`, `logo-reveal`, `logo-reveal-v2`,
`lower-third` and `color-transition` — were deleted in Stage 16 and remain recoverable from git
history if ever needed.

The library deliberately covers overlays, graphics and backgrounds, and not clip-to-clip
transitions: OpenReel already ships 24 native transition types (including
`flash` and `wipe`) that blend outgoing and incoming footage, which an overlay clip cannot do.

Each one has a `components/<id>/meta.json` describing its params, defaults and ranges — that file is
the contract the editor UI and render-service read.

## Render one component

```bash
node scripts/render.mjs --component stat-counter \
  --props '{"label":"Active users","targetNumber":1250,"durationInSeconds":3}' \
  --out ../../storage/rendered/demo.webm
```

Flags: `--component` `--props` `--out` `--fps` (30) `--width` `--height` (default to the
`--background` `--keep-frames`.

With no `--background` the render is transparent (VP9 + `yuva420p`). Pass `--background "#00ff00"`
to render on a solid chroma-green backdrop and encode `yuv420p` instead — that is what the editor
uses, because OpenReel drops the alpha channel on import and keys the green out instead.

Requirements: `ffmpeg` on PATH, and an installed Chrome/Chromium/Edge (`puppeteer-core` uses the
system browser — override the path with `CHROME_PATH`). Everything runs locally; no cloud services.

## Preview while authoring

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens the Motion Canvas editor at <http://localhost:9000> with all three projects, using each
component's default props.

## How rendering works

Motion Canvas has no CLI renderer, and its `@motion-canvas/ffmpeg` exporter is hardcoded to MP4 /
`yuv420p` (no alpha). So `scripts/render.mjs` assembles the pipeline itself: a programmatic Vite dev
server, headless Chrome loading `render-harness.html`, Motion Canvas's built-in image-sequence
exporter writing PNGs with alpha through Vite's HMR channel, then ffmpeg muxing them to VP9 +
`yuva420p`. See the Stage 2 section of the repo's `NOTES.md` for the details and for a known
limitation: OpenReel imports these files cleanly but currently drops the alpha channel when
compositing.

## Adding a component

1. `src/scenes/<id>.tsx` — the animation. Read params via
   `useScene().variables.get("key", default)()`.
2. `src/projects/<id>.ts` — `makeProject({scenes:[scene], variables: resolveProps(DEFAULT_PROPS)})`.
3. `components/<id>/meta.json` — param schema.
4. Register the project in `vite.config.ts` and in `PROJECTS` in `src/render-harness.ts`.
