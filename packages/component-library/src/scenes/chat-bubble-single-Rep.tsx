/**
 * chat-bubble-single-Rep — one Replika chat bubble, arriving.
 *
 * A port of ui-animation's balloon bubble: the 8-anchor Bézier silhouette (see
 * lib/balloon-geometry.ts) with the house entrance — 240ms on cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1),
 * fading, rising 10px and growing from 0.94, anchored to the corner the bubble belongs to.
 *
 * There is no exit. The source's `enterStyle` returns an empty style once the entrance
 * finishes and nothing else ever touches the bubble again, so the clip holds the settled
 * frame for the rest of its duration rather than inventing a way out.
 *
 * The entrance is a fixed 240ms and does NOT stretch with durationInSeconds — see ENTER in
 * lib/chat-timeline.ts for why.
