/**
 * Text measurement for anything sized by its own text - the balloon bubbles and the CTA
 * buttons - plus the font-readiness gate.
 *
 * ## Why measure at all
 *
 * The bubble's silhouette is drawn from the measured size of its text box, so W and H are
 * not decoration — they are inputs to the geometry. In the source the browser wraps the
 * text, a ResizeObserver reads the padded box, and PreText re-runs the wrap off-DOM via
 * canvas so the box hugs its widest rendered line instead of staying stretched to maxWidth
 * (a wrapped bubble otherwise keeps 50–100px of dead space on the right). Motion Canvas
 * gives no equivalent, so the wrap is reproduced here: greedy, canvas-measured, with the
 * source's +1px subpixel guard.
 *
 * ## Why the font gate is here
 *
 * A missing @font-face fails silently — the text renders in a fallback, every bubble
 * measures to a different width, and the silhouette is drawn to match, so nothing looks
 * broken enough to notice. The source guards against this at capture time (its readiness
 * check waits on `document.fonts.load` and then polls geometry until it stops moving,
 * precisely because "capture too early and every bubble is a fallback-font width"). This
 * render pipeline had no such gate at all, so `ensureFont` adds one and throws rather than
 * quietly rendering in Arial. See NOTES.md Stage 23.
