/**
 * One balloon bubble as a Motion Canvas node tree: the Bézier silhouette, its shadow, and
 * the text laid out on the lines the measurement decided.
 *
 * The bubble is built with its rect centred on the node's origin. `Path` subtracts its own
 * bbox centre from its computed layout (Curve.js), so the drawn silhouette centres on the
 * node position; the bow is symmetric on all four sides, so that centre coincides with the
 * centre of the W x H rect the text is measured into. The text is positioned from the same
 * centre, which keeps the two in register without either one depending on how the bbox
 * happens to sample.
 *
 * Everything here is built at fontSize 16 (scale 1), where every constant in
 * balloon-geometry.ts is exactly as the designer tuned it. Larger output comes from scaling
 * the whole node, never from raising fontSize — `maxWidth` is deliberately absolute in the
 * source, so a bigger font would wrap into more lines inside the same 220px column instead
 * of enlarging the bubble.
