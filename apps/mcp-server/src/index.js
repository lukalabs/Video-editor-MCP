const OPS_VOCABULARY = `
Each entry is an object with an "op" field plus that op's parameters. Ops are applied in
order, atomically: if any one fails, none are saved. Ids created along the way come back in
the response ("results"), so you can add a clip in one call and trim it in the next.

Timeline model: a project has tracks; each track holds clips positioned in seconds.
"Video 1" (the FIRST track) renders on TOP of later tracks — put overlays on an earlier
track than the footage they sit over.

Available ops:

- add_media { id, name?, metadata, type? }
    Registers already-uploaded media in the project library. Pass the "mediaId" and
    "metadata" object exactly as returned by upload_media. Required before add_clip.
    type ("video" | "audio" | "image") is inferred from the metadata and only needs
    passing to override it - upload_media returns the same value as "mediaType".

- add_track { name? }
    Appends a track. Returns { trackId }.

- add_clip { trackId, mediaId, startTime, duration?, inPoint?, metadata?, allowOverlap? }
    Places media on a track. startTime is where it begins on the timeline (seconds).
    duration defaults to the media's full length; inPoint (default 0) is how far into the
    source the clip starts, so { inPoint: 2, duration: 3 } uses source seconds 2-5.
    Still images have no inherent length (metadata.duration is 0), so their clips default
    to 5 seconds - pass duration explicitly to hold one on screen for longer.
    Overlapping an existing clip on the same track is rejected unless allowOverlap: true.
    Returns { clipId }.

- trim_clip { clipId, startTime?, duration?, inPoint? }
    Changes any of those; outPoint is kept consistent automatically. Cannot extend past the
    source media's length.

- move_clip { clipId, trackId?, startTime? }
    Moves a clip to another track and/or another time.

- split_clip { clipId, time }
    Splits at an absolute timeline time that must fall strictly inside the clip. Returns
    { clipId, newClipId } — the original keeps the earlier half.

- remove_clip { clipId }
    Deletes the clip and any transitions referencing it.

- set_effect { clipId, type, params?, enabled? }
    Adds or replaces an effect on a clip (replaced by type, so calling it twice with the
    same type updates rather than duplicates). Useful types: "chromaKey" (params:
    keyColor {r,g,b} 0-1, tolerance, edgeSoftness, spillSuppression), "brightness",
    "contrast", "saturation", "blur", "grayscale", "invert", "sepia", "vignette", "grain",
    "sharpen". Omitted params fall back to sensible defaults.

- remove_effect { clipId, type? | effectId? }

- set_audio_fade { clipId, fadeInSeconds?, fadeOutSeconds? }
    Fades the clip's audio up from silence at its start and/or down to silence at its end,
    over that many seconds. Linear, applied to the clip's own gain, and included in the
    exported mix - no need to pre-process the file with ffmpeg before uploading. Pass one
    end to change only that end; 0 on both removes the fade. Fades that together exceed the
    clip's duration are rejected. Use set_clip_transform's volume for a flat level change.

- set_clip_transform { clipId, transform?, opacity?, volume? }
    transform accepts { position:{x,y}, scale:{x,y}, rotation, anchor:{x,y}, fitMode }.
    fitMode is "contain" | "cover" | "stretch". opacity and volume are 0-1.
    A video clip's OWN embedded audio is mixed into the export by default, alongside
    anything on your audio tracks. If you only want your own music or voiceover, silence
    the video clip with volume: 0 - do not pre-process the file or rebuild the audio bed.
    Silence in an audio track is exported as real silence, so gaps and a music bed shorter
    than the timeline are fine and stay in sync.

- add_text_clip { trackId, text, startTime, duration, style?, transform? }
    A text overlay. style accepts { fontFamily, fontSize, fontWeight, color, strokeColor,
    strokeWidth, textAlign, verticalAlign, lineHeight, letterSpacing }. transform.position
    is NORMALISED here (0-1, so { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 } is centred), unlike clip transforms
    which are pixel offsets. Returns { textClipId }.

- add_transition { clipAId, clipBId?, type, duration?, params?, edge? }
    A transition between two clips on the same track (or anchored to one clip's edge with
    edge: "in" | "out" and no clipBId). type is one of: crossfade, dipToBlack, dipToWhite,
    wipe, slide, zoom, push, circleReveal, blur, whipPan, radialWipe, pixelate, glitch,
    blinds, diamondReveal, spin, flip, splitReveal, flash, filmBurn, mosaic, ripple,
    pageTurn, colorSplit. params may be omitted entirely — every type has defaults (e.g.
    wipe/slide take { direction: "left"|"right"|"up"|"down" }, dipToBlack takes
    { holdDuration }).

- rename_project { name }
`.trim();
