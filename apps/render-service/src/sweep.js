/**
 * Disk housekeeping for the three storage directories.
 *
 * Each sweep is deliberately conservative in a different way, because the three directories
 * have different truths about what "still needed" means:
 *
 *   media/     - a row is orphaned when no saved project mentions its id (Stage 9's rule).
 *   rendered/  - a component render is finished work that may not have been collected yet,
 *                so a file is only removable once nothing references it AND it has sat
 *                there past a grace period.
 *   exports/   - nothing ever references an export; it is output. Pure retention: keep the
 *                newest N and anything younger than the age limit.
 *
 * Every sweep supports dryRun, because the first question about a delete-things job is
 * always "what would it have deleted".
